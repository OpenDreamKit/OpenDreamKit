Logilab (\url{http://www.logilab.fr/}) is a french SME focused on using the web and free software to help
scientists. It has been in business since 2000 and counts over 20 engineers and
PhDs proficient in software engineering, knowledge representation, design and
management of IT infrastructure, etc.

Logilab invests 15\% of its turnover in research and development and has been
part of several R\&D projects at the national and european levels, always to
provide technical expertise and support to the other partners.

In the context of this project, Logilab will innovate to support the partners
with tools and infrastructure, including open databases to flexibly store
mathematical objects, user interfaces to visualize complex mathematical
properties, fluid workflow tools to ease large-scale collaboration, etc.

%Logilab's PIC number is 948455525.

\subsubsection*{Publications, products, achievements}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item CubicWeb is a semantic web framework that is available under the LGPL
   license and received a DataConnexion prize from Etalab (the french government
   team dedicated to Open Data)

\item Logilab has been contributing to free software since its creation in 2000
  and is known for it in France and several other countries. It authored PyLint,
  the static Python code checker used worldwide, and has always had at least one
  Debian Developer on staff, thus supporting the largest free software
  distribution used by millions of people.

 \item At OBHM 2013, the 19th Annual Meeting of the Organization for Human Brain
   Mapping, Logilab presented a poster which explains the work done using
   CubicWeb on brain imaging and genetics data in collaboration with INRIA,
   INSERM and the CEA during the Brainomics project co-financed by Agence
   nationale de la Rercherche.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Previous projects or activities}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Logilab was a member of the consortium for the ASWAD EU project, with a
  role of software developer. The project demonstrated the interest of free
  software for setting up workflows in public administrations.
\item Logilab was a member of the consortium for the KIDDANET EU project, with a
  role of software developer. The project implemented a proxy to protect kids
  browsing the internet.
\item Logilab was a member of the consortium for the PYPY EU project, with a
  role of software developer. The project implemented a Python interpreter in
  Python, to explore new ways to compile and optimize the execution of Python
  code.
\item Logilab was a member of the consortium for the OpenHPC french project,
  with a role of software developer. The project advanced the state of the art
  of free software for high performance simulation.
\item Logilab was a member of the consortium for the BRAINOMICS french ANR
  project, with a role of software developer. The project advanced the state of
  the art of shared databases for the brain imaging and genetics data.
\item Logilab was a member of the consortium for the THALER french ANR project,
  with a role of software developer. The project advanced the state of the art
  of free software for high performance simulation of molecular dynamics.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}

Logilab is maintaining its own infrastructure, using virtualisation techniques
and tools such as OpenStack, SaltStack, Docker, etc.
