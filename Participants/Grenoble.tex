The Université de Grenoble  partner gathers two teams form the Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann
(CASYS team, with Jean-Guillaume Dumas and Laurent Fousse) and the Laboratoire d’Infor-
matique de Grenoble (MOAIS, with Thierry Gautier, Clément Pernet and Jean-Louis Roch). The
CASYS team is specialized in Algebraic computations, cryptology, codes and hybrid symbolic-
numeric dynamical systems. The MOAIS team is specialized in programming and scheduling
design on distributed resources for applications based on interactive simulation. The software
developed by this partner is significant. It includes K AAPI , L IN B OX and also G IVARO (C++
library for arithmetic and algebraic computations), PAC (Parallel Algebraic Computations),
Galet (Matrix multiplication schedule generator), FFSpMV (sparse matrix-vector product over
finite fields), PaloAlto (cryptology on curves and cryptanalysis toolbox), Taktuk (tool for de-
ployment of parallel remote executions of commands to a large set of remote nodes), etc.

\item[Software projects]\
  \begin{description}
 \item[\texttt{fflas-ffpack}:] An open-source \texttt{C++} library offering dense
    linear algebra kernels over a finite field. In the same  spirit as the
    numerical \texttt{BLAS} (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines), and
    \texttt{LAPACK} libraries, it delivers high performance for the most
    commonly used routines of scientific computing: matrix multiplication,
    solving linear systems, computing echelon forms, determinants,
    characteristic polynomials, etc. This library has set the standard
    approach for high performance exact dense linear algebra. It is currently
    used in \texttt{Sage}, and has inspired the design of similar routines in
    most commercial computer algebra softwares: \texttt{maple}, \texttt{magma}, etc.
  \item[\texttt{LinBox}:] An open-source \texttt{C++} middleware library for
    exact linear algebra. It uses \texttt{fflas-ffpack} for its dense finite
    field linear algebra part and extends its functionalities to other
    computation domains (integers, rationals, polynomial rings) and type
    matrices (sparse and structures matrices, black-box
    matrices). \texttt{LinBox} is integrated in \texttt{Sage}. 
  \item[\texttt{Pythran}:] An open-source \Python-to-\texttt{C++} optimizing compiler
    offering an high performance runtime for Scientific Python kernels. Dynamicity of
    the \Python language is not compliant with static compilation. That's why only
    a subset of the \Python language is supported by \Pythran. Thanks to these
    restrictions, \Pythran generate code up to 3000 faster than original module.
    \Pythran takes advantage of mutli-cores and SIMD instruction units and,
    thanks to type inference, it requires little annotations. Its runtime
    supports a growing subset of the \Numpy package.
