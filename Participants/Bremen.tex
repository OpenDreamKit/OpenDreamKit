Jacobs University is a private Anglo-Saxon style research university.  It opened in 2001
and has an international student body (1320 students from 115 nations as of 2011).  The
KWARC (KnoWledge Adaptation and Reasoning for Content~\cite{KWARC:online}) Group headed by
{\emph{Prof.\ Dr.\ Michael Kohlhase}} specializes in knowledge management for STEM.
Formal logic, natural language semantics, and semantic web technology provide the
foundations for the research of the group.

\paragraph{Relevant previous experience:}

The KWARC group is the lead implementor of the OMDoc (Open Mathematical Document) format
for representing mathematical knowledge \cite{Kohlhase:OMDoc1.2} and redeveloped its
formal core in the OMDoc/MMT format~\cite{RabKoh:WSMSML13}. The latter has been
implemented in the MMT system~\cite{MMTSVN:on,RabKoh:WSMSML13} which provides efficient
implementations of the computational primitives such as type checking, flattening, and
presentation at a logic/foundation-independent level.  The group has developed services
powered by such semantically rich representations, different paths to obtaining them, as
well as platforms that integrate both aspects.  \emph{Services} include the adaptive
context-sensitive presentation framework provided by the MMT API and the semantic search
engine MathWebSearch\cite{KohSuc:asemf06,ProKoh:mwssofse12}. 

Semantic services can be integrated into the documents generated from OMDoc/MMT
representations, making them into ``active documents'', i.e. documents that are
interactive and adaptive to the user and situation.  For \emph{obtaining} rich content,
the group investigates assisted manual editing \cite{JucKoh:sidesc10:biblatex} as well as
automatic annotation using linguistic techniques \cite{GinJucAnc:alsaacl09}.  Finally,
KWARC has developed the \textsf{MathHub.info} portal a community-based library and
knowledge management system for flexiformal libraries, which can be used for semantic
publishing and eLearning~ \cite{KohDavGin:psewads11,MathHub:on,IanJucKoh:sdm14}.

The \textsf{OMDoc/MMT} knowledge representation format and the \textsf{MathHub.info}
system will an important basis for the developments Work Packages 4 and 6.

Michael Kohlhase has initiated and led the CALCULEMUS! IHP-Research and Training Network
and participated in the FP6 IST MoWGLI (Mathematics on the Web: Get it by Logic and
Interfaces) project, the FP6 CSA Once-CS (Open Network of Centres of Excellence in Complex
Systems), The FP7 EDC project WebALT (Web Advanced Learning Technologies).

\paragraph{Specific expertise:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Modeling formal structures of mathematical knowledge in a web-scalable way
\item Transforming large collections of legacy scientific publications to semantically
  structured markup
\item Designing user interfaces for authoring and interacting with mathematical knowledge
\end{itemize}

- [x] checked that sum of person months put into finance request is
  the same as sum of person months associated with the Work Packages
  (in proposal.tex, as defined as part of the \begin{workpackage}"
  command.
  
  Take into account person months associated with work package 1, time
  of all staff to be hired and work on the project (including
  investigators). Figure 5 helps with a quick check of the sums over
  different work packages.

- [x] completed site specific resource summary in resources.tex,
  including table of non-staff costs. This is compulsory (EU
  regulations) if the non-staff cost exceed 15% of the total cost, and
  is likely to be the case for most of the partners. We ask everybody
  to do it, to be consistent and show transparently how we have
  planned our total budget.

- [x] Have all our tasks a designated lead institution? Check in the
  Work Packages that all the tasks you are involved in have a
  dedicated lead party. If the lead party is "USO", then use:
  \begin{task}[lead=USO]

- [x] Have all our deliverables a designated lead institution [using
  the 'lead=' key]?

- [ ] In the "Members of the consortium section", have we addressed "a
  description of the legal entity and its main tasks, with an
  explanation of how its profile matches the tasks in the
  proposal"? See Entry for Paris Sud and Southampton as examples.

- [x] In the Members of the consortium section, have we given
  descriptions of all the people we intend to hire (even if we don't
  know who that is yet). 
  
- [ ] Do all our tasks include us in the list of sites involved?
