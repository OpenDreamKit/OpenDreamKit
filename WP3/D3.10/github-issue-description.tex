Tentative content: - Context (can be borrowed from the text of T3.3):
ease of installation, better sustainability, supporting Binder, \ldots{}
Maybe include some quotes on how sceptical people (including us) were
about the feasibility. - Prerequisites: work on refactoring Sage's build
system and modularizing Sage's code base; work on libgap (described in
D5.15 \#113), Cython bindings to PARI (\#83, \#84). - Contributions to
packaging Sage and dependencies for Debian, Conda, \ldots: mention Sage
Days 77, Sage Days 85, Sage Days 101. Recall here the means of
distribution on Windows (D3.7 \#66), MacOS and docker images (D3.1
\#58). Packaging work for all other components: JOOMMF, Jupyter
components, etc. Assess long term sustainability: amount of recurrent
work needed, available manpower, \ldots{} - Fostering contributions as
extension packages: pip packages using Sage: sage-sample, sage-package,
recursive-monkey-patch, sharing best practices (wiki page, tutorials at
Sage Days); GAP's package manager (described in D5.15 \#113. Collect
some statistics on external packages for GAP and Sage (will be used for
KPI's) - Do we want to mention this here? along ODK, the KWARC group has
professionalized the release process for MMT. - Any relevant work on the
Singular side, the LinBox side?

Where do we want to mention work on low-level software integration? E.g.
Cernay workshop on low level interfaces, experimentation with cppyy,
cysignals, \ldots{} contributions to packaging and interfacing
libsemigroups, \ldots{} In this deliverable or elsewhere?
