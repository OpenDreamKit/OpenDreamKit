  \begin{definition}[id=ec.q.def]
    An \defii{elliptic}{curve} over a \trefi[field]{field} $K$ is a smooth projective
    curve $E$ defined over $K$ of genus $1$ together with a (distinguished) $K$-rational 
    point $O$ (called the \defii{base}{point}) of $E$.
  \end{definition}
  
  \begin{assertion}[type=remark]
    The most commonly used model for \trefis{elliptic}{curve} is a plane cubic defined by
    a \trefi[Weierstrass-model]{Weierstrass}{equation}, with the \trefii{base}{point}
    being the unique point at infinity\ednote{reference}.
  \end{assertion}
  
  \begin{assertion}[type=remark]
    \guse{minimal-Weierstrass-model} Note that such an equation is not unique over
    $\RationalNumbers$. $E$ has a unique reduced
    \trefiii[minimal-Weierstrass-model]{minimal}{Weierstrass}{model}.

  \begin{definition}[id=ec.q.minimal-Weierstrass-model.def, 
    title=Minimal Weierstrass model of an elliptic curve on $\RationalNumbers$]
    Every \trefii[elliptic-curve]{elliptic}{curve} over $\RationalNumbers$ has an 
    integral Weierstrass model (or equation) of the form
    \[\minwe xy{\livar{a}1}{\livar{a}2}{\livar{a}3}{\livar{a}4}{\livar{a}6}\]
    where $\livar{a}1,\livar{a}2,\livar{a}3,\livar{a}4,\livar{a}6$ are integers.  Each
    such equation has a \trefi[discriminant-weierstrass-equation]{discriminant}
    $\wediscriminantOp$.

    A \defiii{minimal}{Weierstrass}{model} is one for which
    $\absolutevalue\wediscriminantOp$ is minimal among all Weierstrass models
    for the same curve.  For elliptic curves over $\RationalNumbers$, minimal models
    exist, and there is a unique minimal model which satisfies the additional constraints
    $\minset{\livar{a}1,\livar{a}3}{\set{0,1}}$, and $\inset{\livar{a}2}{\set{-1,0,1}}$. 
    This is defined as the reduced minimal Weierstrass model of the elliptic curve.
