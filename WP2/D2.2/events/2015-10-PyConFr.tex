\begin{event}{PyConFr}{pyconfr}{Pau (France), 2015-10-17 to 2015-10-18}{PS}{around 200 participants}{http://www.pycon.fr/2015/}

\textbf{Main goals.} PyConFr is the main gathering of the python community in France. It is a good place to meet the 
French open source python community and to talk and learn about projects.

\textbf{ODK implication.} Viviane Pons was present at the meeting and she gave a talk
on her \href{http://www.pycon.fr/2015/schedule/presentation/16/}{teaching experience using SageMathCloud}. She was
also part of a panel on diversity. 

\textbf{Results and impact.} This event was an occasion to introduce ODK to the larger python community in France as well as to
keep active the link between Sage development and other python open source projects. It is always a great occasion to discuss subjects
 such as user interfaces, cloud servers, best practices, communities, etc. The diversity panel in particular was a great success bringing
 together most of participants of the event. As this is a great concern for ODK, we were happy to be part of it.
