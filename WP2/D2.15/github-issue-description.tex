An important key to the success of the ODK project is linked to its
ability to \textbf{foster a community} in the spirit of the open source
projects it is built on. Part of this relies on the organization and
participation to scientific and development events of many different
scales and objectives. Following up on D2.2
(\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/42}{\#42})
for year 1, and D2.11
\href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/36}{\#36} for
year 2 and 3, we report here on more than 113 events we have been part
of during year 4. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the (co)organization of 25 development workshops;
\item
  the (co)organization of 40 training workshops -\/- or sessions within
  larger events -\/- including 9 in developing countries;
\item
  the (co)organization of 14 community building workshops, 4 of which
  targeted at women;
\item
  the organization of 7 research workshops or sessions;
\item
  communications at and participation to 27 external events.
\end{itemize}

We describe each event with its specific goals and explain the exact
implication of ODK in the organization and realization of the event. We
give a general overview of the impact of single events, thus drawing a
picture of ODK impact as a whole.
