\title{Draft Data Management Plan for OpenDreamKit}
\author{Benoît Pilorget (Editor)}

\begin{document}

\section{Introduction}

This document aims at gathering the information about the data created in the research process within the OpenDreamKit frame:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] Data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications
\item[2] Other data (i.e. curated data not directly attributable to a publication, or raw data)
\end{enumerate}
Its goal is only to collect general information on the data you can produce. 
What you must ask yourself is therefore: "what do I create in order to improve my research work?"
Any answer to that question is potential data. Data can be divided into datasets according to their nature (code, surveys, measurements etc).

Each site must fill in this document with the information they can give at the moment (a small paragraph is enough for now, but if you can do more, go on) More precise information will be needed as the project goes on.

This is only the draft of the 1st version of the Data Management Plan.
The final version of the document will be at the end of the OpenDreamKit project itself.



\section{Datasets}

\subsection{UPSud}

Most of the data created by UPsud is related to the software \Sage and will be incorporated into the \Sage codebase. There might also be smaller data sets of tutorials, documentation and teaching content independent of the \Sage codebase which will be stored accordingly to the size and needs.
\begin{description}
\item[Data storage and security] All addition to the the \Sage codebase will be stored within the distributed \Sage repository on the trac server \href{http://trac.sagemath.org/}{trac.sagemath.org}. For smaller datasets, we might use other distributed git repositories and store a central clone on platforms such as github. All the present data is public, and there is no concern about
unauthorised access. Through cloud hosting and local clones of
repositories, there are backups and redundancy.
\item[Dissemination] The \Sage codebase is publicly accessible through he trac server \href{http://trac.sagemath.org/}{trac.sagemath.org} and distributed within the \Sage software. For other data, we have an open access and open source policy and will advertise the data sets accordingly.
\item[Preservation and future access] By using the distributed system git to manage most of our data, we assure a local copy of the data within each participant machine. We rely on external platform (trac and github) for public access. If it should happen that those platforms are not available any more, the data can easily be moved away to another platform.
\end{description}


\begin{enumerate}



\item {Dataset 1}


\begin{description}
\item[Name of data] Addition to the \Sage codebase
\item[Nature of data] Software code
\item[Licence] GPL
\item[Reuse of existing data] The data is added to the already large existing \Sage codebase.
\item[Mean of production] Code implementation by UPsud participants.
\item[Data standard] The code is mostly written in Python, also using the Rest syntax for documentation and \Sage coding conventions.
\item [Usage for further experiments] The code is merged in the software and can be distributed and reused through the Software. Through the git history,
one can trace back older versions of the code and re-enable a former state of the software.

\item{Dataset 2}


\begin{description}
\item[Name of data] The OpenDreamKit website
\item[Nature of data] Text and metadata concerning OpenDreamKit participants and activities
\item[Reuse of existing data]
\item[Mean of production] Written by OpenDreamKit participants
\item[Data standard] Source code is written in Markdown language and converted into html.
\item [Usage for further experiments]
\item [Link] \href{http://opendreamkit.org/}{opendreamkit.org}, \href{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit.github.io}{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit.github.io}
\end{description}

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{UStan}

Most of the data created by UStan is related to the software \GAP and
will be incorporated into the \GAP codebase. There might also be
smaller data sets of tutorials, documentation and teaching content
independent of the \GAP codebase which will be stored accordingly to
the size and needs.
\begin{description}
\item[Data storage and security] All addition to the the \GAP
  codebase will be stored within the distributed \GAP repository on
  github or a related repository. All the present data is
  public, and there is no concern about unauthorised access. Through
  cloud hosting and local clones of repositories, there are backups
  and redundancy.
\item[Dissemination] The \GAP codebase is publicly accessible through
  github and mostly distributed as part of \GAP.
  For other data, we have an open access and open source policy and will advertise the data sets accordingly.

\item[Preservation and future access] By using the distributed system
  git to manage most of our data, we assure a local copy of the data
  within each participant machine. We rely on external platform for public access. If it should happen that those
  platforms are not available any more, the data can easily be moved
  away to another platform. Datasets which are no longer being
  actively worked on will also be archived in the University's
  research data repository and on zenodo.

\subsection{CNRS}

The data created by the CNRS concerns mainly contributions to the softwares \PARIGP and \Sage.
\begin{description}
\item[Data storage and security] All additions to the \PARIGP software are stored on their server which is hosted at the University of Bordeaux, France.
\item[Dissemination] The \PARIGP code, documentation and various binaries are publicly available on the server \href{http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/}{pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr}. These are also packaged for major linux distributions.
\item[Preservation and future access] The \PARIGP software has existed
  since 1979 and its website since 2003. It gets supports from various
  French and European institutions and has been hosted at the University of Bordeaux since its creation.
\end{description}


\subsection{Jacobs University}

The data created by the Jacobs University team will be in the form of OMDoc/MMT
flexiformalizations (representations of mathematical knowledge and data at flexible levels
of formality). Most data will be generated by transforming and semantic preloading of
existing data sources (the mathematical data bases from WP6.)

All data will be hosted publicly on the MathHub portal (\url{http://mathhub.info}), a
dedicated information portal for active documents and data (flexiformal knowledge with
integrated semantic services). MathHub data is stored, versioned, and protected by the
state-of-the art GIT system.

Original data and will be licensed under an open knowledge license (see
)\url{http://opendefinition.org}, transformed data will be licensed as open as the
original license allows it.

\subsection{University of Southampton}

There are no significant data sets associated with the work at Southampton. The most important data is resulting code and associated documentation and tutorials. The details below refer to this data set, and we expect the data set to be fairly small (order of 1 GB).
\begin{description}
\item[Data storage and security] Data Storage: The code is stored in a distributed repository (git at the moment), and a central clone of this repository is stored with Github.com in the cloud. We may use multiple repositories, and store a central copy of each on Github.com.

  Security: All all the code is public, and there no concern about unauthorised access. Through cloud hosting and local clones of repositories, there are backups and redundancy.
\item[Dissemination] Data can be accessed through the public repositories, and the public website (probably this URL: \href{http://joommf.github.io}{http://joommf.github.io}, tbc), providing open access.
\item[Preservation and future access] We rely on provision of the data through \href{github.com}{github.com} but maintain local copies of the repository in case github.com ceases to exist or suffers from catastrophic technology failure. It is likely that other online repository hosting providers would be able to fill the gap (bitbucket.org is an existing alternative). The University of Southampton offers long term storage of small data sets for 10 years -- the repositories would fall into this categories. While the data wouldn't be conveniently accessible, this provides an extra layer of backups, from which accessible repositories and websites could be created easily.
\end{description}


\subsection{Simula Research Laboratory}

This subsection will contain all datasets Simula Research Laboratory
(SRL) is currently able to describe.

All data sets produced by the work at SRL so far is in the form of
source code and associated documentation and example files.
The size of the produced data is small, on the order of tens of MB.

\begin{description}
%  Quickly explain how data are stored and protected within yout institution
\item[Data storage and security] All source code is stored in public
  repositories on www.github.com using the distributed version control
  system git. This means full copies of all files including their edit
  history are located on both external cloud infrastructure with
  professional backup routines and the personal computers of
  developers, and in the event of failure of either system restoring
  is trivial.

% How data can be disseminated -> openaccess etc
\item[Dissemination] Data can be accessed through the public Github
  repositories, providing open access. All source code is published
  under the standard open source licence for source code related to
  the Jupyter project, namely the ``Modified BSD License''.

% How data can be preserved and available in the next years
\item[Preservation and future access] All data from SRL is published
  through public repositories under an open source licence, and
  copyright is assigned to the Jupyter project. This ensures the
  results can be kept alive and developed further alongside the
  Jupyter project. The Jupyter project has multiple international
  partners, both inside and outside Europe, both academic and
  commercial, ensuring continuation far beyond the end of
  OpenDreamKit.

\end{description}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item nbdime, a new subproject of Jupyter for diff and merge of Jupyter notebooks
    \begin{description}
    \item[Name of data] nbdime project
    \item[Nature of data] Software code
    \item[Licence] Modified BSD Licence
    \item[Reuse of existing data] The data reuses conventions from the
      existing Jupyter codebase, and reuses external open source
      software libraries where applicable.
    \item[Mean of production] Code implementation by SRL participants.
    \item[Data standard] The code is written in Python and Javascript, using Jupyter coding conventions.
    \item [Usage for further experiments] When completed, researchers
      and developers can use this tool to merge Jupyter notebooks
      when working with git repositories, an important improvement to
      a reproducible scientific workflow.

\subsection{University of Warwick}

The datasets produced by the University of Warwick which are relevant
to ODK are all related to with the LMFDB database, which is currently
hosted at Warwick.  As well as the LMFDB database itself, the
different components of the data are created and stored in a variety
of places, and we only list here those for which researchers at
Warwick are responsible.
