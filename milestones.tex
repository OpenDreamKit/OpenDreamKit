\eucommentary{Milestones means control points in the project that help to chart
  progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the
  next phase of the work to begin.  They may also be needed at intermediary points so
  that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a
  critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide
  which of several technologies to adopt for further development.}

The work in the \TheProject project is structured by four milestones, which coincide with
the project meetings held at the end of each year of the project (four other meetings will
be held in the middle of each year). Given the nature of the project, with a large number
of essentially independent tasks, there is no need for milestones attached to specific
collections of tasks or deliverables. Instead, given that the meetings are the main
face-to-face interaction points in the project, we schedule the milestones for these
events, where they can be discussed in detail, tracking the progress in each work package
through status reports on the tasks and deliverables.

We envisage that this setup will give the project the vital coherence
in spite of the broad interdisciplinary mix of various backgrounds of the
participants.
