# Project focus:

OpenDreamKit aims to deliver flexible toolkits enabling research
groups to set up Virtual Research Environments, customised to meet the
varied needs of research projects in pure mathematics and
applications, and supporting the full research life-cycle from
exploration, through proof and publication, to archival and sharing of
data and code.

To reach that aim, OpenDreamKit fosters and builds on a
sustainable ecosystem of community-developed open software,
databases, and services, including popular tools such as Linbox,
MPIR, Sage, GAP, PariGP, LMFDB, Singular, and the interactive
computing environment Jupyter.

# High Level service catalogue

## For researchers:

OpenDreamKit contributes to the development of

- A collection of easy to deploy packages, containers or virtual
  machines for the major open source computational mathematics
  software systems;

-  Protocols for accessing such systems as a service;

-  Interactive computational environments (Jupyter);

-  Web-based databases (LMFDB, Findstat, ...) with a semantic
  API for remote queries;

-  Full VREs based on the above.


## For other RI/e-infras

## For other communities of users

Most of the tools codeveloped by OpenDreamKit are of use for teachers,
students, and so on, in mathematics and beyond.

# Project positioning with respect to

## Similar initiatives

OpenDreamKit works in close collaboration with SageMathCloud, a cloud
based Virtual Research Environment for Mathematics whose primary
instance is based in Seattle.

## National and regional e-infrastructure

OpenDreamKit is not an infrastructure provider per se. Instead,
researchers will use its toolkit to setup VRE's on top of existing
infrastructure (local, cloud based, ...) which will provide storage,
computational power, etc.

OpenDreamKit is reaching toward the major regional and national
infrastructures to test and ease the setup process on top of those.
