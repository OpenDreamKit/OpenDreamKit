\begin{wpobjectives}
  The objective of this work package is to further develop the community at the
  European scale, foster cross teams collaborations, spread the
  expertise, and engage the greater community to participate to the
  definition of the needs, and the implementation and use of the
  produced solutions. This includes:

  \begin{compactitem}
  \item reviewing emerging technologies;
  \item ensuring awareness of the results in the user community;
  \item engaging cross communities discussions to foster scientific collaborations and conjoint developments;
  \item spreading the expertise through workshops and trainings;
  \item defining individual exploitation plans; and,
  \item managing existing and new intellectual property.
  \end{compactitem}
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription} 
  We will organize regular open workshops (e.g. Sage Days, Pari Days,
  summer schools, etc.); some of them will be focused on development
  and coding sprints, and others on training. This is also an occasion
  to organize cross communities workshops like Sage-IPython days.


  This work package will also provide general travel budget to fund
  short to long term visits between the participants, to collaborate
  on specific features. A typical such visit would bring together an
  IPython developer with a GAP developer for a couple of days to
  implement a first prototype of notebook interface to GAP.

  This work package will complement and lean on a parallel COST
  network whose role is to build and animate the greater community.
\end{wpdescription}

\begin{tasklist}
\begin{task}[title=Reviewing emerging technologies]
  In this task, we will produce periodic reviews of emerging technologies and relevant
  developments elsewhere, and implications for our plans. This include the review of
  standard components and service for storage and sharing, computational resources,
  authentication, package management, etc. This may further include negotiating access or
  shared development when appropriate. This information will be fed to the other work
  packages, in particular Work Package~\WPref{component-architecture} Component
  Architecture.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Dissemination and Communication activities]

  \TODO{scale this down as appropriate}

  This task comprises all forms of direct dissemination and public communication
  activities such as press releases, creation of the project web-site including visitor
  analysis and monitoring tools, scientific and technical publications, outreach
  activities (seminars, keynote talks, media interviews, press releases), pro-motion
  through social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn), creation of advertisement
  materials such as flyers, posters, and electronic feeds as well as their distribution.

  % News articles will be produced by experienced professional staff
  % at relevant partners including ... and communicated to local,
  % national and international media, as appropriate.

  At least two press releases will be generated in the course of the project.
  
  \TODO{neil: this coming year i will do four workshops, although the number may be
    smaller by the time we are up and running. an additional component that could be
    integrated here is a 'JMLR Monthly Notices' section that I recently gained approval
    for. This is a new section the leading machine learning journal that we'll aim to
    focus on typically smaller advances (less than a full paper). A little like a 'Nature
    Notices' section but much more informal and open. We don't yet know the best way of
    doing it, but the mechanism might be similar to ways we'd want to disseminate
    \TheProject results.}
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Community building: development workshops, lead=PS]

We will organize development workshops all throughout the project. The aim of these workshops
is to bring together developers from the different communities to implement some key aspects of \TheProject: user interface, documentation, cross compatibility, etc. These meetings will gather not only participants of \TheProject but also members of the different communities involved. Bringing talented people together is the best way to make actual progress on the different aspects of \TheProject. It is also a way to work within the communities we're reaching and include them in the discussions and development. It fosters collaborations between scientists and developers from different backgrounds to build tools that are needed by all. 

Each workshop will be aimed at a specific software (\Sage, \GAP, \SMC, \IPython, \Singular, etc.) or be joint meeting between different communities to improve interoperability and joint developments. We are planning to have 4 or 5 such events per year and will produce a activity report every year. More precisely, here is a tentative list of the different events planned so far:

\begin{compactitem}
\item One \Sage worshop per year in Cernay France (near Orsay) where similar gatherings took place before. One of them will be a Sage-Sphinx day, dedicated to documentation.

\item One Atelier \Pari in Bordeaux per year. The team in Bordeaux has a great experience in organizing this kind of \Pari events.

\item Two \Singular workshops and two \GAP workshops in Kaiserslautern over the four years.   

\item Two workshops dedicated to high performance mathematical computing in relations with \WPref{hpc}. One of them should be in Grenoble and the second one in Bordeaux to foster the work with \Pari towards \taskref{hpc}{hpc-pari}. 

\item A joint meeting on the topics of \SMC and \Jupyter in Simula in relations with \WPref{UI}.

\item A joint event between \GAP, \Sage, and \Singular in ICMS, Edinburgh.

\item A joint \Jupyter and \Sage event in Orsay.

\item A joint \LMFDB and \Sage event in Warwick to work towards \WPref{dksbases}.


\end{compactitem}

\TODO{Add workshop report to the deliverables}

\end{task}

%Mike Croucher and Neil Lawrence,Sheffield
\begin{task}[title=Introduce \TheProject to researchers and teachers]

\TODO{Demonstrator?}

In this task, we will develop and deliver materials that will introduce \TheProject to potential users - both researchers and teachers.

Develop a 'taster' seminar (1-2 hours) and follow-up short course (1-2 days) on \TheProject for researchers and lecturers in all disciplines. At Sheffield, this could be added to the set of courses that are offered as part of IT Services' research support department. As such, it could potentially reach all disciplines.

Elements of this work will also be integrated with the GP Summer Schools and Roadshows. The Summer School is now in its fourth edition (over 140 students educated). The Roadshows have taken place in Uganda, Colombia and are scheduled for Italy, Australia and Kenya.

These seminars and short-courses will be used to identify potential collaborators who are interested in utilising \TheProject immediately. We will act as consultants to these collaborators in two ways:

We will work with lecturers at Sheffield to introduce \TheProject to various disciplines via the production of interactive lecture notes. The focus for the student here will not necessarily be on programming but rather on interaction with the subject matter via use of \TheProject. Interactive lecture notes are an area where commercial vendors such as Maplesoft and Wolfram Research are spending a lot of time and money developing material. We will provide technical and programming expertise to lecturers - helping them to develop the interactive part of notes while they provide the subject material.

We will work as consultants with researchers at Sheffield to introduce \TheProject to their workflow. Any projects that successfully do this will be promoted as case studies for \TheProject.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[id=dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment,
  title=Demonstrator: Open source dissemination of \OOMMFNB{} virtual environment,
  lead=USO,PM=5]
  % 4 months person time + 1 months investigator time
  \OOMMFNB{} (see \taskref{UI}{oommf-python-interface} to
  \taskref{UI}{oommf-tutorial-and-documentation}) is build on top of \TheProject and demonstrates the power
  of the environment in a production environment of active OOMMF users. 
  The source code of \OOMMFNB{} will be made available as open source on
  public repository hosting sites (such as github/bitbucket), and
  announced to the community via appropriate mailing list (mumag,
  magpar, nmag, mumax, micromagnum) and other means. We will
  encourage participation of the micromagnetic community in the
  maintenance and development of the tools, and allow time to train
  users to join the \OOMMFNB{} project to drive towards a self-sustained
  \OOMMFNB{} project at the end of the funding period.

  To underpin this process, we will set up a publicly accessible
  Jenkins/Travis continuous integration (CI) system to (i) run
  regression tests (from \taskref{UI}{oommf-python-interface} and \taskref{UI}{oommf-py-ipython-attributes}) routinely when the
  \OOMMFNB{} code changes or OOMMF core code changes and (ii)
  re-execute notebooks (from
  \taskref{UI}{oommf-tutorial-and-documentation}) and use
  as regression test (making using of the outcome of task \taskref{UI}{notebook-verification}). This will
  test user-contributions automatically, and can automatically create virtual environments
  for download that containing the latest versions (\delivref{dissem}{oommfnb-source-and-testing-setup}).

  We will create a manuscript for journal publication (\delivref{dissem}{oommfnb-publication}), summarising the
  approach taken and experience gathered so far. An important point of
  this publication is to provide a reference that can be cited by
  publications making use of the new \OOMMFNB, allowing tracking of
  uptake of this technology in the medium and long run.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Micromagnetic VRE dissemination workshops,
id=dissemination-of-oommf-nb-workshops,lead=USO,PM=6]

  % 3 months person time, 2 months investigator time

We will run a series of workshops
(\delivref{dissem}{oommfnb-workshops}) during the evenings of 4 major
international meetings on magnetism research\footnote{Anticipated most
  significant international meetings in the appropriate time frame are
  61st Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials October
  31-November 4, 2016, New Orleans, Louisiana; 62nd Conference on
  Magnetism and Magnetic Materials November 6-10, 2017, Pittsburgh,
  Pennsylvania; 21st International Conference on Magnetism (ICM 2018)
  July 16–20, 2018, San Francisco, California; 14th Joint MMM-Intermag
  Conference January 14-18, 2019, Washington, DC). Each of those
  meetings is one week long, and serves as a focal point of networking
  for the european and international research community. Other training events have been held in the
past at these conferences and were well attended.} to
disseminate the micromagnetic virtual research environment
(\taskref{UI}{oommf-tutorial-and-documentation} and
\localtaskref{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment}) in the
micromagnetic community. Each conference
attracts around 1500 participants, and we expect at least 30 for our
workshops at every event. Depending on demand, multiple workshops
will be given per conference. 

The taught material will include (i) use of the \Jupyter-based
micromagnetic VRE, and an (ii) introduction to the standard techniques
for contribution to open source software (version control, pull
requests, testing frameworks) to foster excellence in computational
science and to make the micromagnetic VRE project self-sustaining as quickly
as possible. In addition, all teaching materials, including videos,
will be made available on a website.

For each workshop, we request 500 EUR room hire at the magnetism conference
location and the travel expenses for two teachers from Southampton to
attend the one week international conference, totalling (\euro{500} +
2x\euro{2200}=\euro{4900}) per workshop. There are no other direct
costs.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=workshops in developing countries]
In this task, we run a series of workshops in developing countries especially
Africa and South America. Some of these workshops will be joined to CIMPA schools.
The CIMPA is an international organization based in Nice (France) that promote
research in mathematics in developing countries. It organizes each year around
20 schools.

We request 16 K EUR to cover expenses for four workshops (each workshop involving
two persons of \TheProject).

\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Demonstrator: interactive books,
id=ibook,lead=US,PM=30]
  % 2x12 _ 3x 3 months for students

One of important elements of VRE is a common flexible format which
enables the creation of large structured documents. There are many
known solutions to that problem, but they usually compromise the
interactivity of the notebook interface and quality of desktop
publishing software like LaTeX. 

Recently, few approaches tried to bring both interactivity and the
typographic features. Modestly tagged markup language implementation
DocOnce targets the problem of reusability of the document source
code. The MathBook XML is a lightweight XML application for authors of
scientific articles, textbooks and monographs extensively using Sage
single cells for interactive elements. Sphinx documentation software
has been successfully applied for creation of interactive books
containing Sage cells using sagecell plugin. 

The technical aspects of format for interactive publications is a
subject of the task ``Structured documents'' in
\taskref{UI}{structdocs}. In this task we will demonstrate usability
of the results of \taskref{UI}{structdocs} in creation of scientific
textbooks. Three interactive books will be created:

\begin{compactitem}
\item Nonlinear Processes in Biology 
\item Classical Mechanics  
\item Problems  in Physics with Sage/python    
\end{compactitem}

The choice of those particular topics has been made for the sake of maximal diversity. The ``Nonlinear Processes in Biology'' will heavily use numerical ODE and PDE integration with addition to the classical approach. Classical Mechanics will demonstrate power of CAS systems working ``on par'' with numerical tools. The last example will focus mostly on collaborative editing and modularity of content which is produced using VRE technologies. 

The main research aspect for this task will be to find a way for efficient application of computational tools in problems solving and analysis. In addition the work-flow will be optimized in order to explore the full potential of VRE environment. 

In particular we will answer following questions:

\begin{compactitem}
\item How to create a monograph at reusing independently working   building block of text and code?
\item When the interactive worksheet should be used and when  executable code cell inside interactive textbook is sufficient?
\item What are best tools and practices for using single source for with many output targets? 
\item How to collaboratively write reusable course materials?
\item How students can benefit from  using VRE as working tool?
\end{compactitem}


\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Demonstrator: Computational mathematics resources indexing service,
id=index-librorum-salvificorum]
Beyond official documentation and tutorials, users of mathematical
software and VREs learn from a wide array of sources: university
courses, Q\& A sites, web searches, etc.  A simple web search on any
major software component yields dozens of non-official tutorials and
how-tos in many different languages. However, search engines mostly
miss the relevant metadata: how does one find a tutorial on linear
algebra in \PariGP, written at an undegraduate level, in French or
Spanish?

This need has been felt by most communities at some point, and each
has come up with its own solution: most software components (e.g.,
\GAP, \PariGP, \Sage, \dots) simply link material from their official
page; \Sage has a wiki (\url{http://wiki.sagemath.org/}) referencing
additional resources, and used to host a large number of tutorial
worksheets on \url{http://sagenb.org/}; the recent introduction of
public projects in \SMC is sparking approximately the same phenomenon
that had previously happened with \url{http://sagenb.org/}; Ipython
host the Notebook Viewer service (\url{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/}),
which renders (without hosting) community-made notebooks; teaching
institutions host or link their own collections of pedagogical
resources. The list goes on.

These collections are usually incomplete, limited in scope, hard to
search, outdated, etc.  What the community needs is a
community-curated, searchable, metadata-driven, multilingual, platform
agnostic indexing service whose goal is to reference and rank all the
community generated knowledge around a software component or VRE.  

The goal of this task is to create the tool (\delivref{dissem}{ils-tool}) powering such
service, and to host a (free) community-curated index for \TheProject related resources as
a demonstrator (\delivref{dissem}{ils-service}).

\end{task}
\end{tasklist}



Raw material:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Documentation improvements: overview, cross links, overview of
  recent improvements
\item Thematic tutorials
\item Collections of pedagogical documents\\
  E.g. a complete collection of interactive class notes with computer
  lab projects for the ``Algèbre et Calcul formel'' option of the
  French math aggregation (starting from 2014-2015, only open-source
  systems will be supported, and Sage is a major player).
  % See http://nicolas.thiery.name/Enseignement/Agregation/ as a starter
  % Math labs with Sage for first year students in France (L1): http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~omarguin/
\item Localization of the Sage user interface and key documents in
  various European languages.
\item Distribution of the documents either in the main distribution of
  Sage or through the online repository (see collaborative tools).
\item Massive online introduction course to Sage, drawing on the sage tutorial/notebooks.
Could be "First year Sage course in a box".
\item Taking the opportunity of Python courses to propose Sage as a natural extension
for mathematics; an example is French's 
% TODO: The url macro eats the accented letters. 
% It doesn't just eat it, it pukes it back!
``Classes pr\'eparatoires''\footnote{
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_préparatoire_aux_grandes_écoles}}, 
where Python has been recently selected as the language to learn programming\footnote{See 
the ``Annexe'' at 
\url{http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid25535/bulletin_officiel.html?cid_bo=71586}}.
%\item \TODO{please expand!}
\end{compactitem}

% Jeroen: About teaching: in Gent, Sage is already integrated in the
% courses (maybe you can add this, don't know if it's relevant)
% starting in the first year. It's good for the students because it
% helps in 2 ways: it helps them to understand the mathematics better
% and it helps them to learn basic down-to-earth programming (they
% also have a programming course in Java but that contains a lot of
% theory about complicated class structures)
% Same thing in Orsay
% More python centered but same in UZH
% We have also Sage @ Silesia from 1st semester (physics)
