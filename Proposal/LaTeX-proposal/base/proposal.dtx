% \section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
%
% Writing grant proposals is a collaborative effort that requires the integration of
% contributions from many individuals. The use of an ASCII-based format like {\LaTeX}
% allows to coordinate the process via a source code control system like \git or
% \subversion, allowing the proposal writing team to concentrate on the contents rather
% than the mechanics of wrangling with text fragments and revisions. In fact the
% |proposal| package has evolved out of a series of collaborative proposal writing
% efforts, where large teams (up to 30 individuals from up to 20 sites) have written a
% 100-page proposal in three weeks (with over 2000 commits). Such collaborative writing
% sprints are impossible without a revision control system and a ``semantic'' document
% class that generates tables, charts, and deliverable lists from content markup and thus
% takes care of many of the routine tasks of keeping information consistent.
% 
% The |proposal| class supports many of the generic elements of Grant Proposals. The
% package documentation is still preliminary, fragmented and incomplete. 
%
% The |proposal| class is distributed under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public License
% from CTAN archives in directory |macros/latex/base/lppl.txt|.  Either version 1.0 or, at
% your option, any later version. 
% 
% The CTAN archive always contains the latest stable version, the development version can
% be found on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/KWARC/LaTeX-proposal}. For bug reports
% please use the issue tracker there. Please feel free to fork the repository and provide
% extensions and improvements. 
% 
% The development version also contains example proposals and a very useful script that
% generates GitHub issues for all the workpackages, tasks, and deliverables. This is a
% great way of starting up a project and controlling its progress. The OpenDreamKit EU
% project (see \url{http://opendreamkit.org}) uses this for its (very public) project
% planning on the issue tracker at \url{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit} after (also
% publicly) developing the proposal on GitHub.
% 
% Finally, the GitHub reposistory contains example project proposals and specialized
% Makefiles that help start off the proposal development process. These are not part of
% the CTAN/TeXLive distributions.
%
% \section{The User Interface}\label{sec:user-interface}
% 
% In this section we will describe the functionality offered by the |proposal| class
% along the lines of the macros and environments the class provides. 
% 
% \subsection{Package Options}\label{sec:user:options}
%
% The |proposal| package takes the options |submit|, |noworkareas|, |RAM|, |deliverables|,
% |wpsubsection|, |keys|, |svninfo|, |gitinfo|, |numericcites|, and |public|.
% 
% The \DescribeMacro{submit}|submit| option will disable various proposal management decorations
% which are enabled by default for submission.
%
% The \DescribeMacro{noworkareas}|noworkareas| option specifies that we do not want to structure
% our work plan into work areas (see section~\ref{sec:user:wpwa}).
% 
% The \DescribeMacro{RAM}|RAM| option specifies that we specify research assistant months
% in the effort tallies (see section~\ref{sec:user:wpwa}).
% 
% The \DescribeMacro{deliverables}|deliverables| option specifies that we specify
% deliverables in the grant proposal (see section~\ref{sec:user:deliverables}). As the
% deliverables management needs extra support, we only activate them via this option.
% 
% The \DescribeMacro{wpsubsection}|wpsubsection| option specifies that we want to see
% subsections headings for the WPs (and WAs, if we have them).
% 
% The \DescribeMacro{longtasklabels}|longtasklabels| option specifies that we want to long
% task labels (i.e. including the WP and possibly WA numbers)
% 
% The \DescribeMacro{report}|report| option specifies that we want to use the |report.cls|
% class as a basis for |proposal| instead of the default |article.cls|.
%
% The \DescribeMacro{keys}|keys| option specifies that we want to see the values of various
% keyval arguments in the margin.
% 
% The \DescribeMacro{svninfo}|svninfo| option specifies specifies that we want to use the
% |svninfo| package for displaying version control metadata in the document (except when
% the |submit| option is also given). For this we need the |svninfo| metadata line of the
% form 
% \begin{verbatim}
% \SVN $Id: proposal.tex 13610 2007-07-11 04:30:16Z kohlhase $
% \svnKeyword $HeadURL: https://svn.kwarc.info/../proposal.tex $
% \end{verbatim}
% at the beginning of each file (or in the preamble). 
% 
% Analogously, the \DescribeMacro{gitinfo}|gitinfo| option uses the |gitinfo2| package for
% GIT metadata. Note that you will need to install the post-commit hooks in your working
% copy according to~\cite{gitinfo2:on} for this to work.
% 
% The \DescribeMacro{numericcites}|numericcites| option changes citations to numeric from
% the default |alphabetic|.
%
% Finally, the \DescribeMacro{public}|public| option allows to hide certain sensitive
% (e.g. financial) parts of the proposal. For this, the |proposal| class provides the
% \DescribeEnv{private}|private| environment. If the option |public| is set, the parts of
% the document between |\begin{private}| and |\end{private}| do not produce output. This
% is useful for producing public versions of the proposal that hide confidential
% parts. Note that both |\begin{private}| and |\end{private}| {\emph{have to be on lines
% of their own may not have any leading whitespace}} otherwise an error occurs and
% {\LaTeX} gives error messages that are difficult to comprehend. An alternative way to
% distinguish private and public sections are to use the
% \DescribeMacro{\ifpublic}|\ifpublic| conditional: |\ifpublic{3}\else{5}\fi| will result
% in ``5'' in the submitted draft and ``3'' in the public document.
%
% \subsection{Proposal Metadata}\label{sec:user:metadata}
% 
% The metadata of the proposal is specified in the \DescribeEnv{proposal}|proposal|
% environment, which also generates the title page and the first section of the proposal
% as well as the last pages of the proposal with the signatures, enclosures, and
% references. The |proposal| environment should contain all the mandatory parts of the
% proposal text. The |proposal| environment uses the following keys to specify metadata.
% \begin{compactitem}
% \item \DescribeMacro{title}|title| for the proposal title (used on the title page),
% \item \DescribeMacro{instrument}|instrument| for the instrument of funding
%   that you would like to apply for,
% \item \DescribeMacro{acronym}|acronym| for the proposal acronym, possibly accompanied
%   by an \DescribeMacro{acrolong}|acrolong| that explains it. The acronym will also be used in
%   the page headings.
% \item \DescribeMacro{start}|start| for the start date of the proposed fragment of the
%   project, and \DescribeMacro{months}|months| for the length of the proposal in
%   months. Both have to be specified for the |proposal| class to work.
% \item If the proposal only concerns a part of a longer-running project, the
%   \DescribeMacro{since}|since| key allows to specify the date since when the overall
%   project runs. Finally, the \DescribeMacro{fundsuntil}|fundsuntil| allows to specify a
%   date until which the funds last.
% \item \DescribeMacro{discipline}|discipline| for the academic discipline and |areas| for
%   the research areas in that discipline.
% \item \DescribeMacro{PI}|PI| to declare the principal investigator. For collaborative
%   proposals we can use the |PI| key multiple times. The |proposal| package uses the
%   |workaddress| package for representation of personal metadata,
%   see~\cite{Kohlhase:workaddress:ctan} or the file |proposal.tex| for details.
% \item Many collaborative proposals are shared between two institutions, which we can
%   declare with the \DescribeMacro{site}|site| key. As this changes the interface this
%   should not be used for single-institution proposals. We will describe the setup for a
%   single-site proposal below and point out the differences. The example |proposal.tex|
%   is a two-site proposal.
% \item Sometimes it makes sense to document the proposal number in the metadata, e.g. to
%   use the generated metadata file \meta{main}|.pdata| for project reports. The
%   |proposalnumber| can be used for that. 
% \end{compactitem}
% If the |acronym| and |acrolong| are given, then they automatically define the macros
% \DescribeMacro{\pn}|\pn| and \DescribeMacro{\pnlong}|\pnlong| which allow to use the
% project acronym (\underline{p}roject \underline{n}name) and its long version in the
% text. Note that these macros use |\xspace| internallly, so they do not have to be
% enclosed in curly braces.
% 
% There are two ways of organizing the distribution of personnel resources when developing
% a proposal. Either the coordinator takes a \emph{top-down approach} where she assigns
% person months (PM) to the respective site, of she takes a \emph{bottom-up approach},
% where the sites ``request'' personnel resources by marking them up in the CVs of the
% researchers in the site descriptions. |proposal.cls| supports both of these. Support
% for the first is configured via the \DescribeMacro{topdownPM}|topdownPM| key and for the
% other via the \DescribeMacro{botupPM}|botupPM| key. They add respective lines for
% planning in the WA/WP figure (see~\ref{sec:user:wpwa}).
% 
% \subsection{Proposal Appearance}\label{sec:user:appearance}
% 
% The |proposal| environment takes a second set of keyval arguments that allow to
% fine-tune the appearance of the proposal document. \ednote{move the RAM,
% wpsectionheadings,... options here.}
% \begin{compactitem}
% \item If the \DescribeMacro{compactht}|compactht| key is given (it does not need a
% value), then the header tables\ednote{describe them somewhere and reference here} are
% made compact, i.e. the sites that do not have a contribution to the work package or work
% area do not get listed. This is useful for proposals with more than 8 partners.
% \end{compactitem}
%
% The |proposal| package supplies the \DescribeEnv{emphbox}|emphbox| environment to create
% boxes of emphasized material we want to call attention to. 
% 
% \subsection{The proposal Environment and Title Page}\label{sec:user:title}
% \ednote{add documentation}
% 
% \subsection{Objectives}\label{sec:user:objectives}
% 
% The work plan starts with a discussion of objectives, which may be referenced in the
% text later. The |proposal| package provides the \DescribeEnv{objective}|objective|
% environment that allows to mark up individual objectives. It takes a keyval argument
% with the keys |id| for identification, |title| for the objective title, and |short| for
% a short title that can be used for referencing when the title is too long. The
% objectives can be referenced via \DescribeMacro{\OBJref}|\OJBref{|\meta{id}|}| by their
% label and via \DescribeMacro{\OBJtref}|\OJBtref{|\meta{id}|}| by label and (short if it
% was specified) title.
%
% \subsection{Work Areas and Work Packages}\label{sec:user:wpwa}
% 
% Grant proposals have another part that is often highly stylized; the work plan. This is
% usually structured into ``work packages'' --- i.e. work items that address a cohesive
% aspect of the proposed work. These work packages are usually consecutively numbered,
% have a title, and an associated effort estimation. As work packages are the ``atomic''
% planning units, they are usually heavily cross-referenced. A well-written proposal
% usually contains a table giving an overview over the work packages and their efforts and
% a Gantt chart showing the temporal distribution of the proposed work to allow the
% reviewers to get a clear picture of the feasibility of the research and development
% proposed. But this picture is also essential during the development of a proposal (which
% the |proposal| package aims to support), when the work packages (and their estimated
% efforts) usually change considerably. Therefore the |proposal| class standardizes
% markup for work packages and automatically computes the work package table (which can be
% inserted into the table via the \DescribeMacro{\wpfig}|\wpfig| macro) and the Gantt
% Chart (see Section~\ref{sec:user:gantt}).
%
% To achieve the automation, work plan is marked up by the
% \DescribeEnv{workplan}|workplan| environment, which sets up various internal counters and
% bookeeping macros. It contains texts and |workpackage| environments for the work
% packages.
%
% The purpose of the \DescribeEnv{workpackage}|workpackage| environment is to mark up a
% fragment of text as a work package description and specify the metadata so that it can
% be used in the work package table and Gantt chart generation. The metadata is specified
% by the following keys:
% \begin{compactitem}
% \item The \DescribeMacro{id}|id| key is used to specify a label for cross-referencing the
%   work package or work area, it must be document-unique.
% \item The \DescribeMacro{title}|title| and \DescribeMacro{short}|short| keys are used
%   for the work package/group title. The short title is used in tables and should not be
%   longer than 15 characters.
% \item The \DescribeMacro{wphases}|wphases| key is used according to
%   Section~\ref{sec:user:workphase}
% \item The \DescribeMacro{requires}|requires| key can be used to mark, up dependencies
%   between tasks. If |requires=\taskin{|\meta{rid}|}{|\meta{wp}|}| is given in a task
%   with |id=|\meta{t}, then task \meta{rid} in work package \meta{wp} must be completed
%   for task \meta{t} to become possible. This key will draw an arrow into the gantt chart
%   from the end of task \meta{rid} to \meta{t}. Note that dependencies should always
%   point forward in time. Furthermore, note that the fact that dependencies always go
%   from the end of the source to the beginning of the target work phase is intentional,
%   if this does not meet your needs, then you should probably break a work phase into
%   pieces that can be addressed separately.
% \item In single-site proposals, the \DescribeMacro{RM}|RM| (and \DescribeMacro{RAM}|RAM|
%   if the |RAM| option was given) keys are used to specify the estimated efforts to be
%   expended on research and development in this work package. Both are specified in
%   person months. |RM| is used for ``researcher months'' (wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter)
%   and |RAM| for ``research assistant months'' (wissenschaftliche Hilfskraft).
% \item In multi-site proposals, the |proposal| package generates the keys
%   \DescribeMacro{*RM}\meta{site}|RM| (and \DescribeMacro{*RAM}\meta{site}|RAM|) where
%   \meta{site} is any site label declared via the |site| key in the top-level |proposal|
%   environment. This can be used to specify the person months that the site spends on
%   this work package (the value for work areas is automatically computed (remember to
%   run {\LaTeX} twice for this)).
% \item In multi-site proposals the \DescribeMacro{lead} |lead| key specifies the work
%   package or work area lead, the value of this feature should be the short name of the
%   respective partner.
% \item In multi-site proposals the number of sites can be written as
%   |\pdatacount{all}{site}|.
% \item For work packages with many prospers the \DescribeMacro{swsites}|swsites| key
%   can be given (no value needed) to turn the site names sideways to conserve
%   (horizontal) space. 
% \end{compactitem}
% 
% It is often useful to group the work packages in a proposal further (especially for
% larger, collaborative proposals). This can be done via the
% \DescribeEnv{workarea}|workarea| environment, which groups work packages. This
% environment takes the same keys as the |workpackage| environment, except for the
% efforts, which can be computed automatically from the work packages it groups.
% 
% As the author of the |proposal| class likes more structured proposals, using work
% areas is the default, but the |proposal| class can also be used with the
% |noworkareas| option for less structured (smaller) proposals.
% 
% \subsection{Tasks}\label{sec:user:task}
%
% In the work packages we can list tasks that need to be undertaken with the
% \DescribeEnv{tasklist}|tasklist| environment. The individual tasks are marked up with
% the \DescribeEnv{task}|task| environment.  This takes a keyval argument with the keys
% |id| for identification, |title| for a title, and the workphase keys |wphases|, |start|,
% |end|, and |force| (see Section~\ref{sec:user:workphase}). For planning involvement we
% can specify the overall person months via the |PM| key, the task lead via |lead|, and
% the partners involved via the |partners| key. Instead of just listing the partners, we
% can also specify the contributions of the partners with |RM|\meta{site} and
% |RAM|\meta{site} keys. Finally task dependencies can be specified via the |requires|
% key.
% 
% Tasks can be referenced by the \DescribeMacro{\taskref}|\taskref| macro that takes two
% arguments: the work package identifier and the task identifier. As for work packages and
% work areas, there is a long reference variant with work package title:
% \DescribeMacro{\tasktref}|\tasktref|. Finally,
% \DescribeMacro{\localtaskref}|\localtaskref| references a task in the local work package
% by the identifier in its argument.
% 
% \subsection{Work Phase Metadata}\label{sec:user:workphase}
% 
% The |task| and |workpackage| allow the \DescribeMacro{wphases}|wphases| key to specify
% the a list of work phases. The value of this key is comma-separated list of work phase
% specifications of the form \meta{start}|-|\meta{end} or
% \meta{start}|-|\meta{end}|!|\meta{force}, where \meta{start} and \meta{end} delimit the
% run time of the work phase and the optional |!|\meta{force} specifies the work force,
% i.e. the intensity of work as a number between 0 and 1. If no force is given, the
% default is 1. The main reason for specifying this metadata for tasks is to generate a
% Gantt chart (see Section~\ref{sec:user:gantt}). 
%
% \subsection{Milestones and Deliverables}\label{sec:user:deliverables}
% 
% Many proposal formats foresee that project progress will be tracked in the form of
% \emph{milestones} -- points in the project, where a predefined state of affairs is
% reached -- and \emph{deliverables} -- tangible project outcomes that have to be
% delivered. Correspondingly, milestones and deliverables have to be specified in the
% proposal and accounted for in the project reports. To facilitate this the |proposal|
% class and its instances provide a simple infrastructure for dealing with milestones and
% deliverables. 
% 
% Milestones are usually given in a special table\footnote{this is the default provided by
% the base |proposal| class, it can be specialized for proposal class instances by
% redefining the |@milestones| environment and correspondingly the |\@milestone| macro.},
% which we markup up with the \DescribeMacro{milestones}|milestones| environment that
% takes care of initialization and numbering issues. This contains a list of milestone
% descriptions via the \DescribeMacro{\milestone}|\milestone| macro which is invoked as
% |\milestone[|\meta{keys}|]{|\meta{title}|}{|\meta{desc}|}|, where \meta{keys} supports
% the keys |id| for identification |month| for specifying the milestone date (in months of
% the project duration). Milestones are numbered with labels whose shape can be customized
% by redefining \DescribeMacro{\milestone@label}|\milestone@label| and referenced by the
% \DescribeMacro{\mileref}|\mileref{|\meta{id}|}| and
% \DescribeMacro{\miletref}|\miletref{|\meta{id}|}| for a reference with milestone
% title. |\pdatacount{all}{miles}| gives the number of milestones.
% 
% Deliverables are usually defined as part of the work package descriptions (see
% Section~\ref{sec:user:wpwa}) and listed in an overview table in a separate of the
% proposal. As for the milestones, we use an environment
% \DescribeMacro{wpdelivs}|wpdelivs| that contains the deliverable descriptions. These are
% marked up via the \DescribeMacro{wpdeliv} environment which takes an optional keyval
% argument for the deliverable metadata a regular argument for the title and contains the
% description of the deliverable as the body. For the metadata we have the keys |id| for
% the deliverable identifier, |due| for the target date (a number that denotes the project
% month), |nature| and |dissem| for specifying the deliverable nature and dissemination
% status (usually as short strings prescribed by the proposal template), and |miles| for
% the milestone this deliverable is targeted for (specified by the milestone
% identifier). For repeating deliverables (e.g. project reports), both |due| and |miles|
% can contain comma-separated lists. The |status| key gives the status of the
% deliverable. If it has the value |canceled|, then the deliverable is grayed out and it
% is not mentioned in the deliverables table given by |\inputdelivs| below.
% 
%  Deliverables are numbered by labels whose shape can
% be customized by number, where the shape of the label can be specified by redefining
% \DescribeMacro{\deliv@label}|\deliv@label| and referenced by
% \DescribeMacro{\delivref}|\delivref{|\meta{wp}|}{|\meta{id}|}| where \meta{wp} is the
% work package identifier and \meta{id} that if the deliverable and
% \DescribeMacro{\delivtref}|\delivtref{|\meta{wp}|}{|\meta{id}|}| for a reference with
% title. \DescribeMacro{\localdelivref}|\localdelivref| can be used to reference
% deliverables in the same work package. |\pdatacount{|\meta{wp}|}{delivs}| gives the
% number of milestones of the work package \meta{wp} |\pdatacount{all}{delivs}| that of
% all deliverables (aggregating over all work packages).
% 
% Some proposal templates ask for an overview table of the deliverables which aggregates
% the deliverables of the respective work packages and areas ordered by due date. This can
% be generated with the \DescribeMacro{\inputdelivs}|\inputdelivs| macro. This works index
% generation in {\LaTeX}. The |wpdeliv| environment writes the deliverable data to a file
% \meta{main}|.delivs|, which can be processed externally (usually just sorting with
% |sort| in Unix is sufficient) into \meta{main}|.deliverables|, which is then input via
% the |\inputdelivs| macro. Finally, the |issue| key can be used to bind the deliverable
% to an issue identifier in a project management system.
% 
% In some proposals, also work areas can have deliverables, then the above hold
% analogously for \DescribeMacro{wadelivs}|wpdelivs| and \DescribeMacro{wadeliv}|wadeliv|
% environments.
%
% Note that handling deliverables adds considerable overhead to proposal formatting and
% adds auxiliary files, so they are only activated if the |deliverables| option is given
% (see Section~\ref{sec:user:options}).
% 
% \subsection{Project Data,  Referencing, and Hyperlinking}\label{sec:user:hyperlinking} 
% 
% The |proposal| package extends the hyperlinking provided by the |hyperref| package it
% includes to work packages, work areas, \ldots. Whenever these are defined using the
% |proposal| infrastructure, the class saves the relevant information in the auxiliary
% file \meta{proposal}|.aux|. This information can be referenced via the
% \DescribeMacro  {\pdataref}|\pdataref| macro, which takes three arguments.
% 
% In a reference |\pdataref{|\meta{type}|}{|\meta{id}|}{|\meta{aspect}|}| the first argument
% \meta{type} specifies the type of the object (currently one of |wp|, |wa|, and
% |partner|) to be referenced, \meta{id} specifies the identifier of the referenced object
% (it matches the identifier given in the |id| key of the object), and \meta{aspect}
% specifies the aspect of the saved information that is referenced. 
%
% \DescribeMacro{\pdatarefFB}|\pdatarefFB{|\meta{type}|}{|\meta{id}|}{|\meta{a1}|}{|\meta{a2}|}|
% tries first |\pdataref{|\meta{type}|}{|\meta{id}|}{|\meta{a1}|}| and if that is not
% given |\pdataref{|\meta{type}|}{|\meta{id}|}{|\meta{a2}|}|. 
% 
% For a work package \meta{aspect} can be |number|, (the work package number), |label|
% (the label {\bf{WP$n$}} where $n$ is the work package number for referencing), |title|
% (the work package title), |lead| the work package leader, |short| (a short version of
% the WP title for tables). For work areas we have the same aspects with analogous
% meanings. In all cases, the referenced information carries a hyperlink to the referenced
% object.  
% 
% The \DescribeMacro{\pdataRef}|\pdataRef| and \DescribeMacro{\pdataRefFB}|\pdataRefFB|
% macros are variant of |\pdataref| and |\pdataRef| that also carry a hyperlink (if the
% |hyperref| package is loaded).
%
% The \DescribeMacro{\pdatacount}|\pdatacount| macro gives access to the numbers of
% certain aspects. For instance, the number of work packages in the proposal can be cited
% by |\pdatacount{all}{wp}|, similarly for work areas (if they are enabled), and finally,
% |\pdatacount{|\meta{wa}|}{wp}| gives the number of work packages for a work area
% \meta{wa}. This is very useful for talking about work plans in a general way. Other
% objects that can be counted are deliverables (|\pdatacount{all}{deliverables}|) and
% milestones (|\pdatacount{all}{milestones}|).
% 
% Note that since the referencable information is written into the project data file
% \meta{proposal}|.pdata| file, it is available for forward references. However, it will
% only become available when the project data file is read, so the proposal has to be
% formatted twice for references to be correct.
% 
% Finally, the |proposal| package supplies specialized reference macros for work packages
% and areas. The \DescribeMacro{\WPref}|\WPref| macro takes a work package identifier as
% an argument and makes a reference: |\WPref{|\meta{id}|}| abbreviates
% |\pdataRef{wp}{|\meta{id}|}{label}|. The \DescribeMacro{\WPtref}|\WPtref| macro is
% similar, but also prints out the (short) title: |\WPref{|\meta{id}|}| abbreviates
% |\pdataRef{wp}{|\meta{id}|}{label}: \pdataRef{wp}{|\meta{id}|}{title}|. Unless the
% |noworkareas| macro is set, we also have the variants \DescribeMacro{\WAref}|\WAref| and
% \DescribeMacro{\WAtref}|\WAtref| for work areas.
%
% \subsection{The Work Package Table}\label{sec:use:wptable}
% 
% One of the most useful features of the |proposal| class is that we can generate an
% overview table for the distribution of workloads in the project fully automatically. All
% it takes is the \DescribeMacro{\wpfig}|\wpfig| macro. We invoke this as
% |\wpfig[|\meta{opt}|]|, where \meta{opt} contains the following keywords: 
% 
% \begin{description}
% \item |pages| makes a column with page numbers of the respective work package/area description.
% \item |type| makes a column with work package/area types
% \item |start|, |end|, and |length| makes a columns with work package/area start/end
%   months and length (in months). 
% \item if |caption| is given then the table contains an explicatory caption.
% \item |label| allows to specify a label other than the default |fig:wplist|.
% \end{description}
% For instance |\wpfig[pages,start,length,caption=Overview of Work Packages]| gives a
% table with columns for page references, duration information, and a special caption.
% 
% The general appearance of the table \DescribeMacro{\wpfigstyle}|\wpfigstyle| macro takes
% a token sequence to specialize the global appearance (mostly used for text sizes and
% color) of the work package table. Cell styling can be tweaked by redefining special
% internal macros; see section~\ref{sec:implwptable}. 
%
% \subsection{Gantt Charts}\label{sec:user:gantt}
%
% Gantt charts are used in proposals to show the distribution of activities in work
% packages over time. A gantt chart is represented by the \DescribeEnv{gantt}|gantt|
% environment that takes a on optional keyval argument. The keys
% \DescribeMacro{xscale}|xscale| and \DescribeMacro{yscale}|yscale| are used to specify a
% scale factors for the chart so that it fits on the page. The \DescribeMacro{step}|step|
% key allows to specify the steps (in months) of the vertical auxiliary lines.  Finally,
% the \DescribeMacro{draft}|draft| key specifies that plausibility checks (that can be
% expensive to run) are carried out. Note that the value does not have to be given, so
% |\begin{gantt}{draft,yscale=.5,step=3}| is a perfectly good invocation.
%
% Usually, the |gantt| environment is not used however, since it is part of the
% \DescribeMacro{\ganttchart} macro that takes the same keys. This generates a whole
% Gantt chart automatically from the work phase specifications in the work packages. As
% above we have to run {\LaTeX} two times for the work phases to show up.
% 
% \subsection{Coherence}\label{sec:user:coherence}
% 
% Many proposals require ways to show coherence between the partners. The |proposal| class
% offers the macro \DescribeMacro{\coherencematrix}|\coherencematrix| for this which
% generates a matrix of symbols specifying joint publications, project organization,
% software/resource development, and supervision of students by the project partners that
% have been declared by the \DescribeMacro{\jointpub}|\jointpub|,
% \DescribeMacro{\jointsub}|\jointproj|, \DescribeMacro{\jointorga}|\jointorga|
% \DescribeMacro{\jointsoft}|\jointsoft|, and \DescribeMacro{\jointsup}|\jointsup| macros
% before. These macros all take a comma-separated list of site identifiers as an
% argument. Use for instance |\jointproj{a,b,c}| to specify that the sites with the
% identifiers |a|, |b| and |c| have a joint
% project. \DescribeMacro{\coherencetable}|\coherencetable| is a variant which packages
% the coherence table in a table figure with label |tab:collaboration|.
% 
% The symbols used an be configured by redefining \DescribeMacro{\jpub}|\jpub|,
% \DescribeMacro{\jproj}|\jproj|, and \DescribeMacro{\jorga}|\jorga|,
% \DescribeMacro{\jsoft}|\jsoft|, and \DescribeMacro{\jsup}|\jsup|.
%
% \subsection{Localization}\label{sec:use:localization}
%
% The |proposal| class offers some basic support for localization. This is still partial
% though, and I am not sure that this is the best way of setting things up. What I do is
% to define macros for all generated texts that can be redefined in the proposal classes
% that build in |proposal|. For instance the |dfgproposal| class~\cite{Kohlhase:pdrp:ctan}
% provides an option |german| for german-language proposals and project reports that
% triggers a redefinition of all of these macros at read time. 
% 
% \subsection{Project Management}\label{sec:use:project}
%
% Much of the metadata that is explicitly represented in proposals written with the
% |proposal| class is very useful for project management. For instance, it is possible to
% use the metadata in the \meta{main}|.pdata| file to generate issues for all the tasks,
% work packages, and deliverables automatically. The |LaTeX-proposal|
% repository~\cite{LaTeX-proposal:git} contains an experimental script that automates
% that. After that, we can cross-reference them using the \DescribeMacro{issue}|issue| key
% to get extra mileage\ednote{MK: how to use this?}
%
% \section{Limitations and Enhancements}\label{sec:limitations}
% 
% The |proposal| is relatively early in its development, and many enhancements are
% conceivable. We will list them here.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item macros cannot be used in work package and work area titles. They really mess up our
%   |\wpfig| automation. The problem is that they are evaluated too early, and our trick
%   with making them undefined while collecting the parts of the table-rows only works if
%   we know which macros we may expect. We might specify all ``allowable'' macros in an
%   optional key |protectmacro|, which is defined via\vspace*{-.7em}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \define@key{wpfig}{protectmacro}{\epandafter\let\csname #1\endcsname=\relax}
% \end{verbatim}
%  \vspace*{-2em} But I am not sure that this will work.
% \item It would be great, if in the Gantt Charts, we could include some plausibility
%   checks (for draft = not |submit| mode). I can see two at the moment:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item calculating the effort (i.e. the weight of the black area) and visualizing
%     it. Then we could check whether that is larger than the effort declared for the work
%     package.
%   \item calculating (and visualizing) the monthly effort. That should be kind of even
%     (or it has to be explained in the positions requested).
%   \end{itemize}
% \item we currently do not have a way to relate |PI|s to |site|s, but we do not really
%   need to.
% \end{enumerate}
% If you have other enhancements to propose or feel you can alleviate some limitation,
% please feel free to contact the author.

% \subsection{Proposal Metadata}\label{sec:impl:metadata}
%  
% Most of the metadata functionality is encapsulated into the \DescribeMacro{pdata}|pdata|
% package, which is shared by the proposal and report classes. |pdata.sty| first loads the
% |workaddress| package from sTeX and supplies the Euro symbol. 
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<*pdata>
\RequirePackage{workaddress}[2016/07/06]
\RequirePackage{eurosym}
%    \end{macrocode}
% We define the keys for metadata declarations in the |proposal| environment, they park
% their argument in an internal macro for use in the title page. The |site| key is the
% most complicated, so we take care of it first: We need a switch |\if@sites| that is set
% to true when the |site| key is used. Furthermore |site=|\meta{site} makes new keys
% \meta{site}|RM| and \meta{site}|RAM| (if the |RAM| option was set) for the
% |workpackage| environment and records the sites in the |\prop@gen@sites| token register.
%    \begin{macrocode}

%    \end{macrocode}

%    \begin{macrocode}
\defbibheading{empty}{}
%    \end{macrocode}
% We define an internal macro |\prop@ppl| that prints a publication list of a given
% {bib\TeX} entry type and title for convenience. It also adds a |notype=| to the token
% register |\prop@rl| to deal with the unclassified entries from the list.

% The following code does not work yet, it would have been nice to be able to just add a

%   the bibliography, and then adds \meta{refs} to the citable papers marks them as
%   |featured|. Then it uses |\printbibliography| to make a bibliography of the cited
%   papers. Note that these are not cited again in the main bibliography\ednote{MK: we may
%   want to make this optional controlled by a package option eventually.}
