\item \WPref{dksbases}: adapted the titles of \delivref{dksbases}{psfoundation},
  \delivref{dksbases}{pssem}, and \delivref{dksbases}{lfmverif} to respect the change in
  priority on system interoperability and distributed computing in the
  ``Math-in-the-Middle'' Paradigm over algorithm verification.
\item Changed the lead of \delivref{component-architecture}{semantic-interface-sage-gap}

\subsection*{Work Plan revisions, Fall 2017}
\ednote{insert month when ready}

Following feedback from project officer and reviewers at the 18 month
project review, we are proposing the following revisions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reduction of number of deliverables:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Merged \delivref{dissem}{workshops-2} into \delivref{dissem}{workshops-3}.
  \item Merged \delivref{dissem}{ibook2} into \delivref{dissem}{ibook1}.
  \item Merged together \delivref{dissem}{datascience-course},
    \delivref{dissem}{lecture-notes} and \delivref{dissem}{notebook-repo} into \delivref{dissem}{IntroODK}

  \item Merged \delivref{component-architecture}{sage-repository} into \delivref{component-architecture}{sage-distribution}.

  \item Merged \delivref{UI}{cfd-vis} into \delivref{UI}{vis3d}, to be delivered in M36.

  \item Merged \delivref{hpc}{cython-pythran-cilk} into \delivref{hpc}{sage-HPCcombi}.
  \item Merged \delivref{hpc}{LinBox-DSL} into \delivref{hpc}{LinBox-distributed}.
  \item Merged \delivref{hpc}{pari-hpc1} into \delivref{hpc}{pari-hpc2}.

  \item Merged \delivref{dksbases}{conv} into \delivref{dksbases}{psfoundation}.
  \item Merged \delivref{dksbases}{lfmint} into \delivref{dksbases}{psfoundation} and
    \delivref{dksbases}{lfmverif}.
  \item Merged
    \delivref{component-architecture}{semantic-interface-sage-gap} and
    \delivref{dksbases}{pssem} into \delivref{dksbases}{lfmverif}.
  \item Merged \delivref{dksbases}{notebooksearch} into \delivref{dksbases}{nbad-search}.

  \item Merged \delivref{social-aspects}{oommf-nb-evaluation} into
    \delivref{dissem}{oommfnb-vre-deliver}.%, lead by \site{XFEL}.
  \end{itemize}

\item Integration of WP7 activities into other WPs:
  \begin{itemize}
 \item Canceled Objective 6 of \TheProject 
 \item Integrated T7.4 in
    \taskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-workshops}, lead by
    \site{XFEL}. Merged task is now
    \taskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-workshops}.
  \item Canceled \taskref{social-aspects}{social-input} and associated deliverable \delivref{social-aspects}{social-report-three}, and moved PM to WP3.
  \item Canceled \taskref{social-aspects}{social-output} and associated deliverables \delivref{social-aspects}{jupyter-comment} , \delivref{social-aspects}{social-poster} and \delivref{social-aspects}{social-publishing-report} and moved PM to \taskref{dissem}{project-intro}.
  \item Canceled \taskref{social-aspects}{isocial-decisionmaking}, cancelled deliverables \delivref{social-aspects}{social-tracaddon} and \delivref{social-aspects}{social-gametheoretic}, and moved PM to WP3 and WP5.
  \end{itemize}
  The addition of manpower to WP3 and WP5 will enable an extension of
  the scope of the tasks
  \taskref{component-architecture}{portability},
  \taskref{component-architecture}{mod-packaging}, and
  \taskref{hpc}{pythran}.
  Meanwhile, WP2 has proved to be very successful and \TheProject is
  gaining momentum. The addition of manpower to this WorkPackage will
  allow the consortium to answer the increasing demand for
  collaboration and dissemination.


\item Work package specific milestones:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Introduced one milestone at month 42 for
    \WPref{component-architecture}, two milestones at months 36 and 48
    for \WPref{UI}, one milestone at month 36 for \WPref{hpc} and two
    milestones at month 36 and 42 for \WPref{dksbases}.
  \item Removed redundant general milestone at month 36.
  \end{itemize}
\item Complete rework of the Key Performance Indicators to better
  monitor the progress, impact, and results:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Four Indicators linked to the four project aims;
  \item Focus on success stories and qualitative indicators in general;
  \item Reusable, meaningful, and realistic quantitative indicators.
  \end{itemize} 
\item Miscellaneous
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Canceled \delivref{component-architecture}{personal-smc} as
    not relevant anymore: work has been done by the community. The
    corresponding workload has been reallocated, mostly to
    WorkPackage~\WPref{dissem} which needed more resources after the cancellation of \WPref{social-aspects}.
  \item \delivref{UI}{jupyter-import} moved from M24 to M36 to incorporate results
    from workshop on live structured documents.
  \item \taskref{UI}{notebook-collab} expanded from M1-M24 to M1-M48 (the full duration of the grant)
    to reflect the ongoing nature of the work. Activity, total work,
    and deliverables are unchanged.
  \item Typo fix in deliverable title for \delivref{management}{ipr2}
    (reports for year 2 and 3, not just year 2).
  \item Modification of lead for WP6: from Jacobsuni to FAU
  \item Remove the HPC conference in Bordeaux in favor of more dissemination schools and workshops (no modification of resources)
  \item Reduction of 16 PM for UPSUD due to points 9 and 10 of the second Amendment. This modification had accidently not been implemented before in the part A of the Annex 1, therefore this update of the Annex 1 was necessary.
  \item Termination of Jacobsuni on 17/01/2018: all relevant staff for the project was moved to FAU and Université Paris-Sud (originally planned on 31/12/2017 but was postponed to comply with the date of official submission of the amendment on the portal)
  \item Termination of UZH on 17/01/2018: all activity planned for the partner has been accomplished and resources were spent (originally planned on 31/12/2017 but was postponed to comply with the date of official submission of the amendment on the portal)
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{4th amendment to the Grant Agreement, June 2018}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Addition of University of Leeds (UNIVLEEDS) to the list of beneficiaries starting from the 01/05/2018
\item Termination of the University of Sheffield from \TheProject due to the reallocation of staff and all remaining resources to UNIVLEEDS
\item Reallocation of remaining resources that were not used by USHD to UNIVLEEDS
\item Change of lead beneficiary for \delivref{dissem}{IntroODK} from Sheffield to Leeds
\item Update text for Task 3.6 to explain the explain the change of name from the component SAGEMATHCLOUD to 'CoCalc'
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{5th amendment to the Grant Agreement, June 2019}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implementation of a new task T6.11 by a subcontractor and extension of deliverable D6.10 and milestone M10:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Changes to Annex 1 part A:
\begin{enumerate}
\item WP6: addition of a new task T6.11, Isabelle Case study;
\item extension and deferral of deliverable D6.10 from M45 to M48 and
  milestone M10 from M42 to M48.
\end{enumerate}

\item Changes to Annex 1 part B: Addition of a new subcontractor

T6.11 will be conducted in collaboration with Makarius Wenzel, the main developer of Isabelle, who has spent the last ~10 years building the technological prerequisites for such a case study. He is the only person who could collaborate with the FAU team on such a case study.
\begin{enumerate}
\item updated Work plan timing: Gantt chart showing task dependencies and information flows.
\item updated resource summaries for consortium member sites.
\item updated Third parties involved in the Project (including use of third party resources)
\end{enumerate}

\item Changes to Annex 2:

FAU will subcontract the Isabelle Case study to Makarius Wenzel's company for 30k€:
\begin{enumerate}
\item budget transfer of 10k€ from FAU personnel costs budget category to FAU Subcontracting costs budget category;
\item additional 10€ from LEEDS Personnel costs and 10€ from LEEDS other direct costs budget categories (lower incurred eligible costs) to FAU subcontracting costs budget category.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\item As suggested by the project officer, updated management level description of resources and budget (guidelines for outreach costs): addition of "Participants donate their time and typically fund their own travel. Nevertheless, following standard practice in academia, travel costs can be covered for invited speakers, experts, or to support participants with low access to funding (young or coming from developing countries)".

\item As suggested by the Project Officer, formalization of budget
  transfers between beneficiaries to optimize the use of remaining
  resources to achieve the project aims. This includes the
  reallocation of significant unused resources at LEEDS (about 258k€:
  133k€ of personnel Costs, and 73k€ of Other direct costs) due to the
  early departure of all the personnel. Most of the reallocation
  concerns joint work packages with LEEDS, notably WP2 (dissemination,
  ...), with just a shift in the respective involvement of the
  partners. The rest enables a new task in WP6 and supports existing
  tasks, all in line with the original objectives.

\begin{enumerate}
\item List of budget transfers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item USlaski: transfers between USlaski budget categories, 8k€ from Other direct costs and 2k€ from Personnel costs both to subcontracting costs to further develop K3D-jupyter (T4.8, T4.9);
\item FAU: Transfer of 10k€ from LEEDS personnel costs budget category and 10k€ from other direct costs budget category to FAU subcontracting costs budget category (for the subcontracting of the action task T6.11);
\item UPSUD: transfer from LEEDS to UPSUD of 90k€ in the personnel
  costs budget category and 15k€ in the other direct costs budget
  category to support many additional dissemination activities
  organized during spring and summer 2019 (T2.2, T2.3, T2.5), stronger
  involvement in WP3 (T3.1, T3.3, ...), WP4 (T4.5,...), and WP6 (T6.5,
  ...). This covers in particular the much stronger involvement of the
  project coordinator than originally planned (~20PM instead of 12PM
  over the whole duration of the project).

\item UGent: transfer of 16k€ from LEEDS personnel costs budget
  category to UGent personnel costs budget category (T3.3, T4.4,
  T4.12, T5.1);
\item CNRS: transfer of 40k€ from LEEDS other direct costs to CNRS other
  direct costs category for T2.5: 20k€ to cover the organization of an
  additional workshop around Sage Math, PARI/GP and Jupyter, and 20k€
  to cover the organization of the workshop Mathématiques
  Expérimentales originally funded on the indirect costs of RP2 by
  lack of local budget to be declared finally on the direct costs of
  CNRS budget for RP3.
\end{enumerate}  
Taken together, we plan to transfer 116k€ from Leeds Personnel costs
and 65k€ from Leeds Other direct costs categories to other
beneficiaries costs categories. Therefore, the new budget for Leeds,
for the entire duration of the project is, of 25 970,61€ on Personnel
costs and 10 095,55€ on other direct costs.

\item Updated resource summaries for consortium member sites:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Université Paris-Sud;
\item CNRS;
\item University of Silesia;
\item FAU Erlangen Nurnberg;
\item University of LEEDS.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
