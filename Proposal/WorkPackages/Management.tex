%  The objectives of this work package are to undertake all project management activities,
%  including:
%  \begin{compactitem}
%  \item monitoring the overall progress of the project and the use of
%    resources;
%  \item ensuring the timely production of deliverables and other
%    project outputs;
%  \item reporting to the European Commission on financial matters;
%  \item preparing for and attending the annual project review
%    meetings; and
%  \item managing the project Advisory Board.
%  \end{compactitem}

Establish and maintain an effective contract, project, and operational management
approach, ensuring (i) an effective and timely implementation of the project, (ii) quality control
of the results, (iii) risk and innovation management of the project as a whole as well as (iv)
timely and necessary interaction with the EC and other interested parties.

  % The objective of  is to undertake all project management
  % activities, including setting up joint infrastructure, organizing
  % meetings, and producing overview reports.

\begin{wpdescription}
The project will be managed by UPS, which has extensive experience in
administering and leading EU funded and national projects. The
coordinator together with the WP leaders, will be responsible for
monitoring WP status, coordination of work plan updates and annual
internal progress reports. The project management structure and roles
of partners in the consortium are presented in Section~\ref{sect:mgt}.

  The task includes the following activities
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Preparation and Distribution of the
    Consortium Agreement;
  \item Setting up the project website, intranet and
    communication procedures for effective communication;
  \item
    Organisation of project review and progress meetings;
  \item
    Establishment and maintenance of external contacts (with the EC,
    other relevant national / EU projects, other academic and
    industrial stakeholders) to organise transfer of knowledge,
    present and promote project results;
  \item Progress and Financial Reporting to the EC;
  \item Data and IPR Management will be managed in accordance with
    agreed rules stated in the Consortium Agreement and in accordance
    with the Data Management Plans
    (\delivref{management}{infrastructure}, \delivref{management}{data-plan1}, \delivref{management}{data-plan2}).

  lead=PS,PM=15,partners={LL,UV,UJF,UB,UO,USH,USO,SA,UW,JU,UK,US,ZH,SR,UG,FAU,XFEL},issue=15]
  A quality assurance plan will be established to ensure coherent and
  sufficient quality of the work and results. The plan will be
  developed by UPS, involving all partners, and will be followed up
  regularly. In addition, the project coordinator with support from
  the coordination team and quality review board will establish and
  review annually a risk management plan and self-assessment to ensure
  that technical barriers / potential risks are identified and
  corrective measures are put into place on time
  (\delivref{management}{ipr}).

\begin{task}[title=Innovation management,wphases=6-48!.2,

  partners={LL,UV,UJF,UB,UO,USH,USO,SA,UW,JU,UK,US,ZH,SR,UG,FAU,XFEL},issue=16] One of the
  most important criteria for success for the OpenDreamKit project is
  to bring the project results into use. Therefore, exploitation
  routes will be sought whenever possible. In order to create a common
  understanding within the Consortium of how we can best shepherd an
  idea all the way from conception to realisation and
  exploitation, the Coordinator will be responsible for the
  preparation and realisation of an Innovation Plan. This plan will assure that
  research activities meet the required milestones and produce outputs
  fully aligned with the project objectives.  All
  research activities will go through an initial process where the
  exploitation opportunity is identified along with the main
  stakeholders for the exploitation opportunity and an IP owner.
