\begin{wpobjectives}
  The ultimate purpose of a mathematical VRE is to create \emph{data} ($\mathcal{D}$; see
  Section~\ref{sec:innovation}), \emph{knowledge} ($\mathcal{K}$), and \emph{software} ($\mathcal{S}$)
  by modeling world situations, computing mathematical objects, and running
  computational experiments. To be effective a VRE needs an infrastructure that supports
  the creation, management, access, and dissemination of \DKS-Structures.  All
  the systems considered in this proposal (\GAP, \Sage, \Pari, \Singular, OEIS, \texttt{arXiv.org},
  \ldots) already include data, knowledge, and software modules as part of their regular
  distribution, but not in a form that is interoperable between systems, severely limiting
  the usefulness of the systems and results. The objectives of this work package are
\begin{compactenum}
\item to design metadata and representation formats for trans-system $\mathcal{DKS}$
  structures as a basis for a math VRE, 
\item implement interfaces to existing systems for interoperability and compatibility with
  the RE, and
\item implement a joint \DKS infrastructure for, searches, documentation, traceability,
  versioning, provenance, visualisation and native dissemination of \TheProject results
  (the latter three together with \WPref{UI}).
\end{compactenum}
Concretely we will design and build an infrastructure that would make it easy for either
individual mathematicians or a distributed collaboration to manage and use such
interlinked mathematical data. This work would provide part of the backend to \WPref{UI},
and would draw on previous work with the \LMFDB and \FindStat (which will be treated as
prototypes for our purposes, to serve as exemplars to other projects) and in return will
substantially enhance their capabilities.

User prerequisites should be kept to a minimum (depending on contributors' and users'
needs and goals), and in particular would not require any background in databases to
contribute new data or perform queries.
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription}
  We need ways to represent \DKS in the same representational system, make the \DKS
  structures explicit and therefore machine-manageable and -- since current
  computational/experimental mathematics involve quite extensive \DKS -- we need a new
  kind of ``database'', which we will call Mathematical Data/Knowledge/Software-base
  (\textbf{\DKS base}), and which we will build in this work package.

  The starting points for this unification effort will be the system-oriented data bases
  for $\mathcal{D}$, the OMDoc (\underline{O}pen \underline{M}athematical
  \underline{Doc}uments) framework~\cite{Kohlhase:OMDoc1.2} for $\mathcal{K}$.
  OMDoc/MMT~\cite{RabKoh:WSMSML13} is a representation format for mathematical documents
  and knowledge that incorporates a metalogical framework to be foundation-independent,
  which allows interoperability between various ontologies/foundations of mathematics. For
  the integration of $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ we will build on the notion of
  \emph{biform theories} developed by Carette/Farmer~\cite{Farmer:btc07} and extended to
  OMDoc/MMT by \site{JU} in~\cite{KohManRab:aumftg13}. In this setup, the programming
  language serves as a foundation, just as ZFC set theory might for mathematical
  knowledge. Complex relationships between mathematical objects, interpretations of the
  underlying languages, and unit transformations are modeled in a graph of theories and
  theory morphisms.

  The complexity of mathematical \DKS structures is on vivid display in the
  \emph{L-functions and Modular Forms database} project (\LMFDB): while the general shape
  of the functional equation of an $L$-function is dependent on a lot of theoretical
  knowledge, it also requires parameter data and the coefficients of the associated
  Dirichlet series. Once this is obtained, highly optimised (and heavily parallelizable)
  algorithms can be run to compute values of this function.
\end{wpdescription}

\begin{tasklist}
\begin{task}[title={Survey of existing \DKS bases, Formulation of requirements},
  id=data-assessment,lead=ZH,partners={JU,SA,UW,US},wphases=0-3,PM=4,issue=123]
  In this task, we will survey existing databases, the technology used to implement them,
  how they were linked to the rest of the existing infrastructure and the functionalities
  offered. We will also select additional external data and projects to add to this
  effort, aiming to maximise the impact of our work.

  We will organise a workshop associated to this task (see
  \taskref{dissem}{devel-workshops}). Results will be communicated in
  \localdelivref{design}.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Triform Theories in OMDoc/MMT,id=data-triform,
  lead=JU,partners={ZH},PM=12,wphases=0-12,issue=124]
  Work here would extend OMDoc/MMT biform theories along the data axis, which will require
  a specialised but integrated treatment. This integration will serve as a theoretical
  basis informing the design of a \DKS base in \localtaskref{data-design}.

  The results are reported in \localdelivref{dkstheories}.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[id=data-design,lead=JU,partners={ZH,US,SA,UW,LL,FAU},wphases={6-12,15-18!.33},PM=12,
  title={\DKS Base Design},issue=125]
  Ontologies are the canonical method used to implement databases that require significant
  data interchange. However, because of the extreme reification present in mathematics
  (relations between objects themselves become objects of study), there are specific
  obstacles compared to the usual semantic web model of publishing.

  Drawing on semantic web/Linked Open Data experience of the \site{LL} group, specialised
  to mathematics through the OMDoc/MMT work of the Bremen group, we will design a
  decentralised infrastructure for \TheProject. This infrastructure would allow modular
  collaborations, through decentralised hosting of data without the need to merge
  everything centrally.
  
  The initial design of the \DKS base in \TheProject is reported in
 \localdelivref{design}. Conversion issues are covered in \localtaskref{data-foundationCAS}.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Computational Foundation for Python/Sage,
  id=data-foundationCAS,lead=FAU,partners={ZH,SA,JU},PM=9,wphases=6-18!.66,issue=126]
  In the OMDoc/MMT world a foundation is a logical base language that gives the formal
  meaning to all objects represented/formalised in it. We have created a very initial
  computational foundation for the programming language Scala and implemented it in the MMT API. This can be used
  to execute (or verify) computations directly in OMDoc/MMT and thus forms the basis for
  various integration tasks for OMDoc/MMT biform theories that integrate Scala
  computations. Here we propose to develop a somewhat more complete computational
  foundation for Python and/or parts of Sage (coverage to be determined). Bi/Triform
  theories come in three parts:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item \emph{syntax}: what operators/types are there, how do they nest,
  \item \emph{computation}: what does the computation relation look like (sometimes called
    operational semantics). The declarative semantics of a computational foundation can be
    given as an OMDoc/MMT theory morphism into another foundation (e.g. a set theory);
  \item \emph{specification}: what are the observable properties of the computation. 
  \end{compactitem}
  The foundation (a triform theory in OMDoc/MMT) will be published as
  \localdelivref{psfoundation}.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Knowledge-based code infrastructure, id=research-categories,lead=PS,partners={ZH,JU,FAU},PM=21,wphases=12-48,issue=127]
  Over the last decades, computational components, and in particular
  Axiom, MuPAD, \GAP, or \Sage, have embedded more and more
  mathematical knowledge directly inside the code, as a way to better
  structure it for expressiveness, flexibility, composability,
  documentation, and robustness. In this task we will review the
  various approaches taken in these software (e.g. categories and
  dynamic class hierarchies) and in proof assistants like Coq
  (e.g. static type systems), and compare their respective strength
  and weaknesses on concrete case studies. We will also explore
  whether paradigms offered by recent programming languages like Julia
  or Scala could enable a better implementation. Based on this we will
  suggest and experiment with design improvements, and explore
  challenges such as the compilation, verification, or
  interoperability of such code.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=OEIS Case Study (Coverage and automated Import),id=data-OEIS,lead=FAU,partners={JU},
  PM=6,wphases=12-18,issue=128]
In this case study we test the practical coverage of the trifunctional modules, by
transforming an existing, high-profile database (the Online Sequence of Integer
Sequences\footnote{\url{http://www.oeis.org}}) into OMDoc/MMT. The OEIS has about 250
thousand sequences, with formulae, descriptions, definitions, references, software,
etc. in a structured text file (but no standardised format for formulae and references),
so we expect to get 250 k theories. Having the OEIS in OMDoc/MMT form allows to do
Knowledge Management services (presentation, definition lookup, formula search, ...) in
\MathHub (see \WPref{UI}). The OEIS is a good case study, since the data is licensed under
a Creative Commons license which allows derived works. The large size will allow
statistically significant semantic cross-validation of the heuristic transformation
process and thus achieve a significant community resource.

The results of the import are reported in \localdelivref{psfoundation}.
\end{task}

% Michael, I think triformal theories would be easier to start with findstat.org
% There are many reasons: more consistent structure in the mathematical data, more established research patterns, more consistent database storage, tighter integration of the code with sage code (in fact copy paste), etc

\begin{task}[title=FindStat Case Study (Triformal Theories),id=data-findstat,
  lead=FAU,partners={ZH},PM=9,wphases=18-30!.5,issue=129]
  In this task we would develop triformal theories for the \FindStat project \footnote{\url{http://www.findstat.org}} to test the
  design from \localtaskref{data-foundationCAS}.  Similarly to the previous task, in this
  case study, we first develop a thorough OMDoc/MMT model, which should only involve a
  handful of MMT theories (combinatorial collections, maps, statistics,...), each with a
  few hundred realisations. Together with   \WPref{UI}, this will again allow for
  easier knowledge management services, and in particular improved search services.

  This Task will be co-developed with \localtaskref{data-foundationCAS}, it will validate
  the design of triformal theories and be iterated to test the design changes. Results
  will be reported in \localdelivref{psfoundation}.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=\LMFDB Case Study (Triformal Theories),id=data-LMFDB,
  lead=JU,partners={ZH,UW},PM=24,wphases={12-24!.25,24-48!.7},issue=130]
  In this task we would develop triformal theories for an exemplary part of the \LMFDB
  project to test the design from \localtaskref{data-foundationCAS}.  We will identify a
  fragment of the \LMFDB that we want to model and design the model (see
  \localdelivref{psfoundation}). 

  Then we will perform cross-validation of the three model parts against each other
  (essentially model-based testing of software and inference; see
  \localdelivref{lfmverif}). Once this has been successful for the chosen fragment, we
  will try to semi-automatically extend the import and model to the whole \LMFDB to gain
  coverage and integrate it fully into the \DKS base. We expect that this will entail
  quite a lot of work in refactoring the \LMFDB proper, which will benefit the \LMFDB
  community independently of its use in \TheProject.

  Finally, we will pick an algorithm from the \LMFDB and verify it against its
  specification and the computational foundation developed in
  \localtaskref{data-foundationCAS}; this is the final validation of the case study. The
  results are reported in \localdelivref{lfmint}.
  \end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Memoisation and production of new data,id=data-memo,
  lead=SA,partners={US,PS,UW},PM=12,wphases=24-42!.6,issue=131]
  Many CAS users run large and intensive computations, for which they want to collect the
  results while simultaneously working on software improvements. \GAP retains computed
  attribute values of objects within a session; \Sage currently has a limited
  \texttt{cached\_method}. Neither offers storage that is persistent across sessions or
  supports publication of the result or sharing within a collaboration. We will use,
  extend and contribute back to, an appropriate established persistent memoisation
  infrastructure, such as \texttt{python-joblib}, \texttt{redis-simple-cache} or
  \texttt{dogpile.cache}, adding features needed for storage and use of results in
  mathematical research. We will design something that is simple to deploy and configure,
  and makes it easy to share results in a controlled manner, but provides enough assurance
  to enable the user to rely on the data, give proper credit to the original computation
  and rerun the computation if they want to. Results are reported in \localdelivref{persistent-memoization}.

%Mock code:
%    \begin{lstlisting}
%       mycloud = storage("ssh:xxx@yyy/zzz")
%       memoize(sage.combinat...., storage=mycloud, input=ZZ, output=Posets(), key="catalan")
%    \end{lstlisting}
\end{task}

\begin{task}[id=mws,title=Math Search Engine,lead=JU,PM=10,wphases={3-9!.3,21-42!.5},issue=132]
  The advantage of having a unified \DKS base for a math VRE is that we can navigate the
  combined information space of all the underlying tools, systems and resources integrated
  into the VRE. The negative effect is that this aggravates the already serious problem of
  finding anything. Therefore we will adapt the existing MathWebSearch Engine
  (MWS~\cite{ProKoh:mwssofse12,MWSProj:on}) to the \DKS base system. MWS consists of a web
  service that indexes mathematical documents (formula/text) and a web front-end that
  allows users to query the index. Formula queries are highly efficient (25$\mu s$/query)
  and can be combined with keyword/full text search queries. An initial search engine for
  papers and system documentation will be established early in the project (see
  \localdelivref{mws}). For an integration into the \DKS base we only need to build new
  harvesters -- i.e. programs that generate keywords and formula URL/pairs from the
  contents (see \localdelivref{nbad-search}).

  For the data/software components in \DKS this is true in principle, but the formulae in
  code can take many more forms and the notion of a hit URL is not as clear. But the
  theory graph structure and foundation change morphisms can be integrated into search so
  that even systems that are incompatible at first glance can be searched under one
  interface~\cite{KohIan:ssmk12}.

  But this puts high demands on the search interface (user inputs are usually only
  meaningful with respect to a given context). We will explore this together with the
  notebook development -- semantically annotated notebooks and active documents serve as
  an explicit context here together with \WPref{UI}; results of this integration will be
  reported in \localdelivref{nbad-search}.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[id=isabelle,title= Isabelle Case Study ,lead=FAU,PM=10,wphases={45-48!.6},issue=286]
In this case study, we test the practical coverage of the trifunctional modules, by 
transforming an existing, high-profile library of formalized mathematics (the Isabelle library
together with its Archive of Formal proofs) into OMDoc/MMT. Isabelle has about 5000 theories and 
1 million theorems including types, theorem statements, algorithms, and proofs. The Isabelle 
library is a good case study because it will allow investigating the connection between 
computational mathematics (which is typically untyped and excludes axioms/theorems but is 
extremely efficient) with logically formalized mathematics (which is statically typed and 
includes formally stated theorems with verified proofs). The results of the import will be 
reported in \localdelivref{nbad-search}.

\begin{comment}
Another connection: on several occasions, we found that software was the best way to
represent certain databases of mathematical knowledge. E.g. in Algebraic Combinatorics we
have a whole zoo of Hopf algebras. Many of them are implemented in MuPAD/Sage by
specifying the objects that index the basis together with computation rules for the
product and coproduct. When we want to retrieve information about such algebras, it's
usually much more convenient to look at the code than to search through the
literature. Especially since the code is usually more correct than the literature because
it's *tested*.

We may also think of providing an interface to \LMFDB via SCSCP
protocol (http://www.symbolic-computing.org/scscp) so it may
be accessed by a variety of other systems (see their current
list at http://www.symbolic-computing.org/scscp). But it's probably as
good to access it via \Sage.
