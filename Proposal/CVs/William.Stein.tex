\begin{participant}[type=R,PM=0,gender=male]{William Stein}
% I put PM=0, since I will be completely unpaid by this grant.
% I think you may need to say how much resource you (or more
% accurately UW) plans to put in, even though the EU is not funding it.

William Stein is a number theorist at the University of Washington
who does research on elliptic curves and modular forms.
He founded the \Sage project in 2004, wrote a large
amount of the code of \Sage, organised numerous \Sage Days workshops,
and won the {\em 2013 Richard Dimick Jenks
Memorial Prize for Excellence in
Software Engineering applied to Computer Algebra} for his work on \Sage.
He has written dozens of research papers and
also published two mathematics textbooks, and has two more books
under contract to publish within the next year.

Stein's main current software development project is \SMC,
which is an open source web application he launched in 2013
that lets people use \Sage and much more collaboratively online.
In addition to growing the user base and implementing
new functionality, he is also creating a company to make
\SMC better supported and
more widely available and scalable.
