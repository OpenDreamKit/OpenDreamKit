\textbf{The Pari library} is a state-of-the-art library for number
theory and an important component of the Sage computational system.
Together with the \texttt{gp} command line interface and the
\texttt{gp2c} compiler, it forms the Pari/GP package. This deliverable
implements a generic parallel engine in the Pari/GP system, uses it
inside the system to implement fast parallel variants of existing
sequential code and exports it for library users. The released Pari/GP
suite (PARI-2.12) makes those improvements and new features available
for the community, in particular Sage users and all softwares using the
Pari library.

The MultiThread engine transparently supports: 1) sequential
computation, 2) POSIX threads (for a single multicore machine) and 3)
Message Passing Interface (MPI, for clusters). It is used throughout the
library to improve a large number of high-level mathematical algorithms,
including fast linear algebra over the rationals or cyclotomic fields,
fast Chinese remainders, resultants, primality proofs, discrete
logarithms, modular polymomials and isogeny-based algorithms, motivic
L-functions... Those implementations scale transparently between single
core, multicore and massively parallel machines.
