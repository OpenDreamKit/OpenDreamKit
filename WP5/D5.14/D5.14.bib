	abstract = {We present a deterministic reduction to matrix multiplication for the problem of linear system solving: given as input a nonsingular A {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}Z{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}times n and b {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}Z{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}times 1 , compute A{\textasciicircum}-1 b. We give an algorithm that computes the minimal integer e such that all denominators of the entries in 2{\textasciicircum}eA{\textasciicircum}-1 are relatively prime to 2. Then, for a b that has entries with bitlength O(n) times as large as the bitlength of entries in A, we give an algorithm to produce the 2-adic expansion of 2{\textasciicircum}eA{\textasciicircum}-1 b up to a precision high enough such that A{\textasciicircum}-1 b over {\textbackslash}Q can be recovered using rational number reconstruction. Both e and the 2-adic expansion can be computed in O({\textbackslash}MM(n,łog n + łog {\textbar}{\textbar}A{\textbar}{\textbar}) {\textbackslash}times (łog n) (łog n + łoglog {\textbar}{\textbar}A{\textbar}{\textbar})) bit operations. Here, {\textbar}{\textbar}A{\textbar}{\textbar}= {\textbackslash}max\_ij {\textbar}A\_ij {\textbar} and {\textbackslash}MM(n,d) is the cost to multiply together, modulo 2{\textasciicircum}d, two n {\textbackslash}times n integer matrices. Our approach is based on the previously known reductions of linear system solving to matrix multiplication which use randomization to find an integer lifting modulus X that is relatively prime to {\textbackslash}det A. Here, we derandomize by first computing a permutation P, a unit upper triangular M, and a diagonal S with {\textbackslash}det S a power of two, such that U := APMS{\textasciicircum}-1 is an integer matrix with 2 {\textbackslash}perp {\textbackslash}det U. This allows our modulus X to be chosen a power of 2.},

	abstract = {SummaryA method is described for computing the exact rational solution to a regular systemAx=b of linear equations with integer coefficients. The method involves: (i) computing the inverse (modp) ofA for some primep; (ii) using successive refinements to compute an integer vectorx¯x¯{\textbackslash}bar x such thatAx¯≡bAx¯≡bA{\textbackslash}bar x {\textbackslash}equiv b (modp m ) for a suitably large integerm; and (iii) deducing the rational solutionx from thep-adic approximationx¯x¯{\textbackslash}bar x. For matricesA andb with entries of bounded size and dimensionsn×n andn×1, this method can be implemented in timeO(n3(logn)2) which is better than methods previously used.},

Using the shifted number system the high-order lifting and integrality certification techniques of Storjohann 2003 for polynomial matrices are extended to the integer case. Las Vegas reductions to integer matrix multiplication are given for some problems involving integer matrices: the determinant and a solution of a linear system can be computed with about the same number of bit operations as required to multiply together two matrices having the same dimension and size of entries as the input matrix. The algorithms are space efficient.},
