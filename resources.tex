\subsubsection{Travel, dissemination and outreach}
\label{sect:budget-details}

This community building nature of this grant proposal requires a large
number of staff exchanges, work shops with project partners and
workshops engaging the wider community in addition to the usual
management and project review meetings. For dissemination, we need to
target the computer science and focussed community and their conferences
as well as the domains benefitting from \TheProject, such as
Mathematics and Science.

\subsubsection{Travel, dissemination}
\label{sect:budget-details-travel}

We use the following guidelines for expected travel expenses:
\euro{2200} for attendance of a typical one week international
conference outside Europe (including travel, subsistence,
accommodation and registration), \euro{1200} for a corresponding
conference in Europe, \euro{750} for a one-week visit to project
partners, for example for coding sprints and one-to-one visits for
particular research. We expect a similar cost per week when hosting
visitors. For the 6-monthly project meetings, we expect on average a
cost of \euro{400} for travel, accommodation and subsistence.

For a partner site with one investigator and one full time researcher,
we expect that that both will attend all of the 9 project meetings that take
place every 6 months (cost of 9 * 2 * 400 =
\euro{7200}), and that the site spends \euro{2000} per year to host
external visitors contributing to the project (total \euro{8000}). We
expect the investigator and research together to do 4 one-week visits
to other sites (each at \euro{750}, totals \euro{12000}).


For dissemination, we expect the researcher to attend on average 1
international conference and 2 European meetings per year (totals
\euro{18400}) and the investigator to attend one international and one
european gathering (totals \euro{13600}).

Where there are multiple investigators per site, they will share the
travel and associated costs outlined above. Where there are multiple
researchers, or researchers not employed for the full 48 months, the
travel budget is reduced accordingly.

\subsubsection{Outreach costs}
\label{sect:budget-outreach-publication-charges}
We also request \euro{1000} per year per partner to pay for open
access publication charges.

\label{sect:budget-outreach-workshops}
We request funds for outreach activities such as workshops that
facilitate community building, disseminate best practice and
encourages sustained contributions of the community to the project and
beyond the lifetime of the funding. For a one-week workshops reaching
out to the community, we cost these at about 400 EUR per participant
to provide accommodation and catering. A workshop for 15 people will
thus cost about \euro{6000}. Participants donate their time will fund
their own travel. The particular budgeted cost will depend on the
local availability of accommodation and will thus vary from workshop to
workshop. We use creative means to increase value and improve
community building where possible, for example by cooking food
ourselves as done in for this recent workshop
\href{http://wiki.sagemath.org/days57}{http://wiki.sagemath.org/days57}.

Details are given in the tables below and in the work packages.

\subsection{Resource summaries for consortium member sites}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Guidelines for completion of partner specific resource summary:
%
%
% Please explain how many person months for each person are
% requested. Say who is the local lead. Say anything that helps to
% understand why people are recruited as you plan, in particular if
% this deviates from having one research for 48 months.  We can also
% use this bit of the proposal (and the table, see below) to address
% any other unusual arrangements.
%
%
% The table should contain all non-staff costs (the EU requests that
% this table must be present if the non-staff costs exceed
% 15% of the total cost, but it is good practice and will show
% openness and transparency that we show the data for all partners).
%
% Link back from the table to the work packages and tasks for which
% the expenses are required. Add information that makes it easier to
% understand why the expenses are justified.
%
%     To refer to a task in a work package, use "\taskref{WP-ID}{TASK-ID}" where
%     WP-ID is the ID of the work package:
%        WP#: WP-ID - full title
%        ----------------------
%        WP1: 'management' - Management
%        WP2: 'community' - Community Building and Engagement
%        WP3: 'component-architecture' - Component Architecture
%        WP4: 'UI' - User interfaces
%        WP5: 'hpc' - High Performance Computing
%        WP6: 'dksbases' - Data/Knowledge/Software-Bases
%        WP7: 'social-aspects' - Social Aspects
%        WP8: 'dissem' - Dissemination
%
%
%     and "TASK-ID" is the ID of the task. You can set this using
%
%       \begin{task}[id=TASK-ID,title=Math Search Engine,lead=JU,PM=10,lead=JU]
%
%     To refer to deliverables, use "\delivref{WP-ID}{DELIV-ID}" where DELIV-ID is
%     the ID of the deliverable that can be set like this:
%
%       \begin{wpdeliv}[due=36,id=DELIV-ID,dissem=PU,nature=DEM]
%           {Exploratory support for semantic-aware interactive widgets providing views on objects
%           represented and or in databases}
%       \end{wpdeliv}
%
%
% The table is pre-populated with entries most sites are likely
% to need. If a line does not apply to you, just delete it. If you need
% an extra line, then add it. Use common sense: the number of rows should not
% be very big, but at the same time it is useful to give some breakdown/explanation
% of costs.
%
%
% Eventually, try to create you entry similar in style to the others.
% (The Southampton entry is fully populated, so use this as guidance
% if in doubt.)
