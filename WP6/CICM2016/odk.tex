\section{The \ODK project}\label{sec:odk}

The project ``Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit for the Advancement of
Mathematics'''~\cite{OpenDreamKit:on} is a European H2020 project funded under the
EINFRA-9 call~\cite{EINFRA-9}. 

The \ODK consortium consists of core European developers of the aforementioned systems
for pure mathematics, and reaching toward the numerical community, and in particular the
\Jupyter community, to work together on joint needs.

The project aims to improve the productivity of researchers in pure mathematics and
applications by promoting collaborations on \emph{Data}, \emph{Knowledge}, and
\emph{Software}, to make it easy for teams of researchers of any size to set up custom,
\emph{Virtual Research Environments} tailored to their specific needs, and
to support the entire life-cycle of computational work in mathematical research, from
\emph{initial exploration} to \emph{publication}, \emph{teaching}, and \emph{outreach}.

The acceptance of the proposal~\cite{ODKproposal:on} in May 2015 was a strong sign of
recognition, at the highest level of funding agencies, of the values of open science and
the strength and maturity of the ecosystem.

The \ODK projects~\cite{ODKproposal:on} will run for four years, starting from September
2015. It involves about 50 people spread over 15 sites in Europe, with a total budget of
about 7.6 million euros.
The \ODK work plan consists of 58 concrete tasks split in seven work packages. The goals
include creating a component architecture, user interfaces, making high performance
computing accessible, interoperation with a wealth of data sources, and social aspects
of collaborative research.

%\ednote{R3: The technical and formal sections of the paper seem quite well put together.  
%The exposition is clear, and the topic is relevant to CICM.  My only objection was to a 
%couple of early sections that give high-level details on the OpenDreamKit project.  
%For this reviewer, these sections were not high-level enough.  I would recommend to 
%summarise the OpenDreamKit project much more briefly in these early sections, which 
%could save 1 or 2 pages which could then be used to expand the technical and formal 
%points in the rest of the paper.}
%\ednote{R3: After reading Section 2, "The OpenDreamKit Project", I wonder how much of 
%this background could be skipped or compressed so that we could get on with Section 3.  
%It seems the key idea needed is "VRE".  I'm not sure that Section 2 provides adequate 
%background about what you mean by that.}
