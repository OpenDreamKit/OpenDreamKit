Version control tools, such as Git and Mercurial, have become an integral part of
open and collaborative science and software. Version control tools allow proposed changes to be
reviewed ('diffing') and resolve conflicts through combination of changes ('merging'). Jupyter
notebook documents are stored in text files as JSON formatted data. This makes them well suited to
tracking in version control, but the JSON structure can make diffing and merging difficult. We have
developed the nbdime tool for diffing and merging notebook documents with awareness of the
structured nature of the documents, allowing a significantly improved experience over naïve
text-file diffing and merging tools.
nbdime can be integrated into the popular git version control system,

\section{Collaborating on notebooks with nbdime}

Version control tools, such as Git and Mercurial, have become an integral part of open and
collaborative science and software. Version control tools allow proposed changes to be reviewed
('diffing') and resolve conflicts through combination of changes ('merging'). Jupyter notebook
documents are stored in text files as JSON formatted data. This makes them well suited to tracking
in version control, but the JSON structure can make diffing and merging difficult.
We have developed tools for diffing and merging notebook documents with awareness of the structured
nature of the documents, allowing a significantly improved experience over naïve text-file tools.
These tools also provide integration with the git version control system.

We have built a new Python package called nbdime, for \textbf{N}ote\textbf{b}ook \textbf{Di}ffing and \textbf{Me}rging.
nbdime makes use of the nbformat package, part of the Jupyter project.
nbdime aims to improve the experience of scientists collaborating on notebooks,
in particular addressing difficulties in the diffing and merging stages of collaboration.
We submitted the project to Jupyter via the Jupyter Enhancement Proposal process,
and it has been accepted as an official Jupyter project.

nbdime is available on GitHub as https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime

\end{figure}

nbdime provides two mechansims for comparing notebooks. First is a command-line diff of notebooks
via the \texttt{nbdiff} command, enabling use in a text-based terminal where developers spend much
of their time. The key for diffing notebooks is that not all information in a notebook has equal
importance, and not all of it is sensibly viewable as text, such as embedded images. The second
important task of nbdime is displaying text content in a more legible form than the raw JSON. JSON
includes additional structured markup, such as quotation marks, indentation, and escaped
characters, which make the text difficult to read, and appear different from the text a user might
see when they are editing the notebook. By recognizing the structure of the notebook, nbdime is
able to make intelligent decisions about how to display text without additional markup and deemphasize information that is not viewable in a text-only environment.
nbdime includes the structure and metadata with minimal markup, designed for humans to read.
When images or other embedded data is seen, it is replaced by an indication that there is binary data that change, rather than the unintelligible difference between the binary data.

    \caption{nbdiff-web output showing side-by-side comparison of output images.}
    \label{fig:nbdiff-web}
\end{figure}

nbdime also provides a web-based diff viewer via the \texttt{nbdiff-web} command. Notebooks are
most commonly viewed and produced in a web-based environment, with the ability to view rendered
images and HTML. The goal of the web-based viewer is to show the reviewer the actual changes in the
notebook document, including changes in output images and rendered HTML.
This allows the most natural experience of reviewing changes in a document, where the review environment is as similar to the interactive notebook environment as possible.

\section{merging notebooks} % (fold)
\label{sec:merging_notebooks}

\begin{figure}
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{img/nbmerge}
    \caption{The result of nbmerge with a conflict is still a valid notebook.}
    \label{fig:nbmerge}
\end{figure}

One challenge for merging two notebooks using text is the structured JSON information, where
text-based merge strategies can result in a syntactically invalid document. This is a problem for
merging all structured documents, including source code in programming languages such as C, Python,
or \LaTeX, but for tools where the editor is not plain-text, preventing the creation of these
invalid documents. Another challenge for merging is the fact that some of the content in notebooks
is generated, and thus should be treated differently when considering conflicts between two change
sets.

nbdime addresses the issue of conflicts with its own merge mechanism, always ensuring that a valid notebook is the result, even if there are conflicts.
The second task of nbdime's merge tool is to allow users to ignore conflicts on certain fields of the notebook.
There is a hierarchy of significance in the content of notebooks,
and not all changes should be considered conflicting.
For instance, if two change sets both alter certain metadata,
the changes are not significant and automatic resolution of conflicts
can be carried out aggressively by clearing conflicting values.
Similarly for generated output, conflicts can be automatically resolved without the consequences of automatic resolution in the source code.
In the worst case scenario, a notebook can be re-executed to produce new output.

    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/nbmerge-web}
    \caption{nbmerge web-based merge conflict resolution tool allows individual conflict resolution.}
    \label{fig:nbmerge-web}
\end{figure}

When merge conflicts do occur, the nbmerge web tool can be used to view and resolve the conflicting changes one by one.

\section{version control integration} % (fold)
\label{sub:version_control_integration}

nbdime provides integration with the git version control system for its diffing and merging tools.
Git provides two mechanisms for integrating external software for
performing the diff and merge operations on specific files.

The first is called a "driver", and is used internally by git when computing diffs and performing merges. nbdime can register its command-line diff rendering as a diff driver for notebook files.
This can be done as a system-wide configuration, or for individual git repositories.
nbdime also provides a merge driver for auto-resolving conflicts on notebooks,
ensuring that a \texttt{git merge} never results in an invalid notebook document,
and that conflicts can be resolved in the user's familiar notebook-editing environment.

The second git integration point is called a "tool", e.g. "difftool" or "mergetool".
These are like drivers, but allow external applications that may open windows to be launched.
nbdime provides tool entrypoints for diff and merge to launch the web interfaces for viewing diffs
and manually resolving merge conflicts.

\section{Future work}
The current version of nbdime is a working prototype but we expect
some more work to be necessary to make it a polished product.
Designers from the wider Jupyter community will be involved in
polishing the visual presentation of the web interfaces,
and users will become involved in further testing once the tool
reaches a wider user base. Furthermore we expect to be able to
improve the algorithms used for diffing and merging further,
both for improving the diff quality and performance.

While nbdime integrates well into the local git workflow of diffing and merging,
much of the diffing and merging work of today's scientists and developers happens
on public websites such as GitHub or Bitbucket,
where the user cannot customize.
However, these websites do support custom diff viewing of certain file types,
such as images and GeoJSON files \cite{geojson-diff}.
After some maturation of the design of the nbdime-web diff viewer,
we will work with GitHub and others to integrate diff viewing of notebooks into their websites,
as we have done in the past with rendering of single notebooks.
