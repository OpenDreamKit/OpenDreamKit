\begin{participant}[type=leadPI,PM=15,gender=male]{Cl\'ement Pernet}
  Associate Professor at the joint Inria-LIG research group MOAIS, Cl\'ement Pernet is a
  junior researcher in Computer Algebra, parallel computing and coding theory with 16
  papers published in international journals or refereed international conferences. He is
  associate editor of the ACM transactions on Mathematical Software and has co-organised
  10 conferences, including 2 sage-days and the 2012 edition of ISSAC, the leading
  conference in computer algebra.

  Since he was a post-doc at University of Washington, under the supervision of William
  Stein, head of the \Sage project, he has had many contributions to \Sage on the exact
  linear algebra and the symbolic computation tools. He co-authored the book ``Calcul
  Mathématique avec \Sage'' with the chapter on Linear algebra.  Cl\'ement Pernet is the
  founder and lead developper of the \software{fflas-ffpack} library, kernel for dense linear algebra
  over a finite field, delivering high performance computation to \Linbox and \Sage. He is a
  core contributor to the \Linbox library and contributed to the \software{m4ri} library.
