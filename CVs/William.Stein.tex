% I put PM=0, since I will be completely unpaid by this grant.

William Stein is a number theorist at the University of Washington
who does research on elliptic curves and modular forms.
He founded the Sage project in 2004, wrote a large
amount of the code of Sage, organized dozens of Sage Days workshops,
and won the {\em 2013 Richard Dimick Jenks
Memorial Prize for Excellence in
Software Engineering applied to Computer Algebra} for his work on Sage.
He has written dozens of research papers and
also published two mathematics textbooks, and has two more books
under contract to publish within the next year.

Stein's main current software development project is SageMathCloud,
which is an open source web application he launched in 2013
that lets people use Sage and much more collaboratively online.
In addition to growing the user base and implementing
new functionality, he is also creating a company to make
SageMathCloud better supported and
more widely available and scalable.
