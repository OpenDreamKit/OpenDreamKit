  Professor at the Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann, Jean-Guillaume Dumas is a senior
  researcher in Computer Algebra with 40 papers published in international
  journals or refereed international conferences.  Among other things, he is
  vice-president of ACM Special interest group on symbolic and algebraic
  manipulations (SIGSAM), department chair within his Laboratoire (6 research
  teams, 130 members) and has collaborators in USA, Canada, Ireland, Germany and
  Luxembourg; he has also co-organised fifteen international conferences.

  Computer Algebra is a field at the frontier between mathematics and computer
  science, with heavy needs for computer exploration.  Jean-Guillaume Dumas is
  the main developer of the \Linbox and \Givaro \software{C++} libraries 
  (\software{libgivaro1}, \software{libgivaro-dev}, \software{libgivaro-doc}, 
  \software{liblinbox0}, \software{liblinbox-dev} in \software{Debian}) used, 
  e.g., by \Sage respectively as its exact linear algebra and its finite fields.

  Along the way, he coauthored part of the proposal for NSF-INRIA grant QOLAPS
  on Quantfier elimination, Optimization, Linear Algebra and Polynomial Systems
  and he is the director of the French ANR program on High-Performance Algebraic
  Computations.
