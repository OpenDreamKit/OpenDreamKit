%
Ian Hawke is a lecturer in Applied Mathematics at the University of
Southampton and a co-director of the \EUR{12}m EPSRC Centre for Doctoral
Training in Next Generation Computational Modelling. An expert in
nonlinear simulations of relativistic matter and numerical techniques,
he has taught numerical methods in many contexts for ten years. He has
worked on IPython (\Jupyter{}) Notebooks in education, particularly as an
instructor on the ``Practical Numerical Methods in Python'' MOOC,
which builds on other open technologies including OpenEdX and github. The
initial author of the ``Whisky'' relativistic hydrodynamics code, he has
been a contributor to and maintainer of a range of projects used
across the numerical relativity community, including the Einstein
Toolkit, the Cactus infrastructure and the Carpet mesh refinement
code. His recent research has concentrated on numerical methods for
relativistic matter beyond ideal fluids, including modelling sharp
transitions and surfaces, relativistic elasticity, and the first
nonlinear simulations of relativistic multifluids.
