\begin{participant}[type=leadPI,PM=24,salary=7000,gender=male]{Dmitrii Pasechnik}
  is a Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Computer Science of the University of
  Oxford, where he also holds a Lectureship at Pembroke College. Before moving to Oxford
  in 2013, he taught mathematics for 8 years in Nanyang Technological University
  (Singapore). While there, he was successful in receiving individual grant funding
  totalling over \euro 500K, graduated 2 PhD students, supervised post-doctoral
  researchers, and co-organized a 2-months research program at Singapore Institute for
  Mathematical Sciences on a range of topics in computational mathematics, involving over
  100 participants.

  He works on a wide area of interconnected topics, related to computational algebra and
  optimization, combinatorics, algorithm, symbolic computing, and game theory, and
  authored over 70 papers on these topics, several of them using Sage and/or its
  components, such as GAP.

  He is an active Sage developer, and regularly contributes, himself or together with his
  undergraduate or graduate students, new or improved Sage interfaces to various
  mathematical packages and databases. He taught a Sage-based undegraduate course while at
  Nanyang, and has good understanding of the overall Sage development process, as well as
  of development of other open-source software and databases, including their
  social/community aspects.
