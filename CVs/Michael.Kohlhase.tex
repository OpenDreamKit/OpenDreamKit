  Dr. Michael Kohlhase is full professor for Computer Science at Jacobs University Bremen
  and an associate adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

  He studied pure mathematics at the Universities of T\"ubingen and Bonn (1983 - 1989) and
  continued with computer science, in particular higher-order unification and automated
  theorem proving (Ph.D. 1994, Saarland University).

  His current research interests include knowledge representation for mathematics,
  inference-based techniques for natural language processing, and computer-supported
  education. He has pursued these interests during extended visits to Carnegie Mellon
  University, SRI International, and the Universities of Amsterdam, Edinburgh, and
  Auckland.

  Michael Kohlhase is recipient of the dissertation award of the Association of German
  Artificial Intelligence Institutes (AKI; 1995) and of a Heisenberg stipend of the German

  (Resource-Adaptive Cognitive Processes), leading projects on both automated theorem
  proving and computational linguistics. Michael Kohlhase was trustee of the Conference on
  Automated Deduction (CADE), Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM), and the CALCULEMUS
  conference, he is a member of the W3C Math working group, president of the OpenMath
  Society, and the general secretary of the Conference on Intelligence Computer
  Mathematics (CICM).
