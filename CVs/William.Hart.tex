\begin{participant}[type=PI,gender=male]{Dr. William Hart}

William Hart is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of
Kaiserslautern. He is the lead developer of the Flint and MPIR projects
as well as the main author and maintainer of the BSDNT bignum library, the
Nemo and ANTIC libraries and a contributor to various other software packages.

Before coming to Kaiserslautern, held a prestigious five year Career
Acceleration Fellowship ``Algorithms in Algebraic Number Theory'' at Warwick
University in the UK. He has been involved in a number of high performance
computing records, including computation of congruent numbers (subject to the
BSD conjecture) up to a trillion ($10^{12}$).

William is the main author of the FFT code for multiplication of large integers
and polynomials in both MPIR and Flint, which are used extensively by the Sage,
Singular and Macaulay 2 computer algebra systems.

The main focus of William's research has been in algorithms for fast arithmetic, fast integer and polynomial factorisation and to algebraic number theory,
including computation of modular equations and class invariants.
