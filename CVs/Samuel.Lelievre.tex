% post-doc Warwick with Vladimir Markovic,
Samuel Lelièvre is an established researcher in Dynamics and Geometry,
with 10 papers published in international journals including
Annales scientifiques de l'École normale supérieure,
Crelle, GAFA, Geometry and Topology.
He participated in three ANR projects, and has collaborators
in France, Israel, the UK, the USA.
His research in Dynamics and Geometry
often involves explicit and experimental approaches,
for which he writes code in order to explore
combinatorial objects such as square-tiled surfaces,
translation surfaces, group actions, group presentations.

He uses and actively promotes \Sage since 2010.
He is in the top 15 contributors of the AskSage
questions and answers forum.
He co-organised six international meetings including two \Sage Days,
presented \Sage at PyCon-FR-2011 in Rennes,
supervised \Sage tutorials twice at the GDR-IM yearly school
for French PhD students at the interface of Mathematics and
Computer Science, and at the CIMPA/ICPAM school Bobo2012
on Discrete Mathematics (Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, 2012).
